## LOGLINE:
Two siblings are orphaned when their parents' car disappears through a time-warp. Their depressed fairy godfather must help them travel back in time to rescue their mother and father from certain doom.

---

## INT. HOME - EVENING

MIA & LEO BORNSZTEIN are watching cartoons. Leo wears dinosaur pajamas, and there are dino-toys everywhere.

A storm is brewing. The TV is jittering. The babysitter, JENNY, is lost in her mobile phone. Jenny is about 15, blonde, with her hair back in a ponytail. GABE & NINA BORNSZTEIN, dressed in black-tie attire, are frantically moving around the house, getting ready to leave.

**NINA**
*(puts on earrings as she walks)*
So there's chicken nuggets in the freezer, corn dogs, they can have anything you want…

**GABE**
We'll be back by eleven. Midnight. No later.

**NINA**
… just please remember Leo needs his sippy cup by his bed, and really they can go to sleep whenever you think. Probably around 9 …

**GABE**
Twelve-thirty. At the latest.

**JENNY**
*(cheerful)*
Ok, that's great!

**NINA**
And feel free to have whatever you want. There's food in the fridge ..

**JENNY**
Great!

**GABE**
Honey.

**NINA**
And my cell phone's on the fridge. I mean, my number. You have Gabe's number too?

**JENNY**
*(matter-of-fact)*
Yep.

**GABE**
Honey. We really need to …

**NINA**
*(pats herself down)*
Where is my phone? Honey? Do you have my phone?

Mia & Leo glance over, away from the cartoon, briefly. Then start watching again.

**GABE**
What? No … what do you mean?

**NINA**
I just had it.

**GABE**
Nina. We are late.

**NINA**
We're fine! I know! I'm going, I just …

**GABE**
I bet it's in the car.

**NINA**
It's fine. Jenny, just call Gabe if anything happens. I'm sure you'll be fine.

**NINA (CONT'D)**
*(turns toward the kids)*
Guys: be good. We love you.

**MIA**
*(as the TV flickers again)*
Will you be back for bedtime?

**GABE**
Mia. I told you already ... we'll be back when we're back. You'll be fine.

**LEO**
I don't want to go to bed!

**MIA**
But daddy!

**NINA**
Honey, I will check on you when we get home.

**MIA**
Promise?

**LEO**
Promise?

**GABE**
Honey, we gotta go.

**NINA**
Promise.

**MIA**
Daddy?

**GABE**
*(annoyed)*
Mia.

Nina glares at him

**GABE (CONT'D)**
Promise.

## EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Rain starts to fall. We hear thunder and see flashes of lightning. Gabe and Nina burst out the door and rush to the car.

---

## INT. CAR - NIGHT

Gabe starts the ignition and they begin driving. Nina looks for the phone.

**NINA**
Ugh. It's not in here.

**GABE**
*(hands her his phone)*
Here. Call it.

**NINA**
*(dials, the storm is getting really intense. Lots of lighting)*
You need to be nicer to her.

**GABE**
What? I was nice to her.

---

## CUT TO INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (as CAR VOICE OVER CONTINUES):

Montage as Jenny continues texting. Kids comfortable on the couch. Cartoons. Nina's phone, hidden somewhere, is seen buzzing. No one notices.

**NINA (V.O.)**
You were not nice to her. You're too hard on her. You need to remember she's only eight.

**GABE**
She's just ... so ... ugh. You're probably right. It's just that we're late and it's pouring and she needs me to make all these promises.

**NINA**
She just wants to know we'll be there for her.

**GABE**
I know, I know ... let me talk to her when she picks up, ok?

**NINA**
I would ... but there's no ... aaaahhhh!

---

## EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

A huge TIME WARP suddenly opens up in front of the car. Gabe and Nina scream, try to avoid the time warp, but can't, and crash into it violently.

---

## INT. HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUSLY

The TV fizzles out, then explodes with a poof. The lights go out, and the house is dimly lit by the moon and the light from JENNY's phone. In the quiet, everyone notices NINA's PHONE, glowing from beneath a PILLOW.

**JENNY**
What the …

---

## INT. GABE'S CAR - DAY

Nina wakes up. She looks around, breathing slowly, confused. The PHONE is in her hand. Gabe is slumped against the window. She reaches over to rouse him.

**NINA**
Hey ...

**GABE**
Mmghhh....

**NINA**
Hey, wake up...

**GABE**
What's going on ...

**NINA**
You fell asleep.

Gabe comes to, and tries to get his bearings. The trip through the portal was obviously rough; the interior of the car is strewn with random toys, bits of paper, etc. Water drips down the windshield as smoke lofts faintly from under the hood. A toy dinosaur is on the dashboard; Gabe pulls out another toy that has gotten wedged behind his back.

**GABE**
Where are we?

**NINA**
I think we drove into the ditch.

**GABE**
Uhhhh... my head.

**NINA**
*(looking out her window)*
Oh my GOD.

The CAR is in a lush, wet, beautiful SWAMP. Nina is awed by the huge, tropical plants, and hears exotic birds/wildlife sounds.

**GABE**
*(trying to start the car)*
C'mon, c'mon ...

**NINA**
Gabe, you have to see this.

**GABE**
One sec ...

**NINA**
No, honey, this is crazy!

**GABE**
This is crazy! I got the battery changed two months ago!

Nina opens her door a bit, then a sharp intake of breath.

**NINA**
Honey, this is NOT a ditch.

**GABE**
Well. Culvert, whatever.

**NINA**
No. I mean ...

Gabe cranks the key in the ignition; the engine thunks but won't turn over.

**GABE**
It's dead. I hate this car.

I'll call a tow truck.

**NINA**
... it's amazing ...

**GABE**
Honey? Do you have my phone? I need to call ...

**NINA**
*(stepping gingerly outside)*
... what are these plants?

**GABE**
*(leaning over the passenger side)*
Honey. Can I have the phone please? This thing's not going to start...

Gabe tries to open his door. It's jammed. He crawls awkwardly through the car and out the passenger door.

**GABE (CONT'D)**
... we probably need to call Jenny too, she's going be wondering what .. the ... heck is going on ... ??

---

## EXT. JURASSIC SWAMP - DAY

NINA marvels at her surroundings. GABE steps out mid sentence and abruptly stops. Nearby, unnoticed, is a small, nearly-closed TIME WARP. It's bright blue, slowly-spinning vortex of energy about the size of a backpack, a few feet off the ground. A small, cute WEIRD CREATURE investigates it humorously.

**NINA**
Do you remember something weird from last night? Like ... a big lightning bolt or something?

**GABE**
A lightning bolt?

**NINA**
Yeah. Or, like, a fireball ...

**GABE**
Actually, now that you say it. It wasn't a fireball though, was it?

**NINA**
No. More like a big ... y'know ...

**GABE**
What?

**NINA**
I mean. Like. A time warp? From a movie. Didn't it kind of look like that?

**GABE**
Oh honey, come on.

**NINA**
I'm serious! I think it was a time warp. Or a wormhole.

**GABE**
*(sarcastic)*
Or a portal to another dimension?

Nina spots the TIME WARP and the WEIRD CREATURE.

**NINA**
Yes. Just like that.
*(pointing)*

Gabe turns slowly and sees the TIME WARP.

**GABE**
What the ...

A distant ground rumble. The WEIRD CREATURE freezes, scuttles away in fear. An eery stillness. They look at each other.

**NINA**
Sshh. What was that?

A deeper, closer rumble. Nina and Gabe are very still. Another, much closer rumble. The CAR ALARM goes off and they jump.

**GABE**
Something is going on here...

**NINA**
I'm telling you.

**GABE**
We need to call 911.

**NINA**
We need to call the kids.

A huge TYRANNOSAURUS REX appears through the trees, tipping its gigantic head this way and that to get a better look at the humans.

**GABE**
We need to ... run!

Nina and Gabe turn and flee, stumbling through the swamp brush as the T-REX begins to chase them. It moves slowly, in great lurches, covering lots of ground. In one step, it smashes the CAR, silences the CAR ALARM, and roars.

---

## EXT. JURASSIC DENSE BRUSH - DAY

Nina and Gabe flee out of the swamp into a DENSE FOREST of ferns, as behind them the T-REX smashes through the UNDERBRUSH, destroying everything in its path.

**GABE (CONT'D)**
Go go go go!

**NINA**
Last night! I told you! It was a time warp!

**GABE**
*(out of breath)*
I mean ... I don't think ... how could it ...

**NINA**
*(screaming, panting)*
Why can't you ever admit when you're wrong?!

Gabe spots what looks like a safe spot (a hollow tree)

**GABE**
Over here!

He pulls her toward it, but a smaller (still terrifying) DINOSAUR appears, blocking their path. They turn another way, the T-REX right on their heels. The OTHER DINOSAUR joins the chase.

**NINA**
You weren't nice to her and it was a time warp and now you're going to get us both killed!

**GABE**
I'm going to get us killed?! What about them!?

NINA spots A CAVE to hide in.

**NINA**
This way!

She grabs GABE by the SUIT COLLAR and yanks him in her direction. They slide into the cave just as the T-REX catches up to them.

---

## INT. JURASSIC CAVE - DAY

Outside the cave the T-REX's CLAWS are seen. GABE and NINA huddle together in terror, inching back into safety. The OTHER DINO catches up, and the two are distracted in a confrontation. Their roaring and fighting sounds overlap the dialog that follows.

**NINA**
This is not good.

**GABE**
Seriously.

**NINA**
We need to get out of here. We have to get back to the car.

**GABE**
Are you crazy? Do you see that thing?

**NINA**
We have to find a way to get back...

**GABE**
It's as big as our house. Did you see how fast it was?

**NINA**
It's bigger than our house.

**GABE**
This is crazy. Straight out a movie ... Leo would be going nuts.

At this, both stop, remembering the kids.

**GABE (CONT'D)**
Oh no.

**NINA**
Leo.

**GABE**
Mia.

They look at each other. Then down at the phone, still in NINA'S hand.

CUT TO:

---

## EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

POLICE CARS parked in the DRIVEWAY. An OFFICIAL in front talking on the phone. Next door a NEIGHBOR grabs his newspaper and snoops, curious what's going on.

---

## INT. HOUSE - MORNING

Jenny speaks with DETECTIVE McNATTIN in the dining room. He's tall, pale, and not recently-shaven.

**MCNATTIN**
So did anything feel funny when they left? Were they upset, nervous, anything like that?

**JENNY**
No. Not really. I mean ... well ...

**MCNATTIN**
What?

**JENNY**
They were, kinda, fighting? I guess.

**MCNATTIN**
Fighting.

**JENNY**
Kinda. Yeah. Arguing.

**MCNATTIN**
Ok.

**JENNY**
And in a hurry.

**MCNATTIN**
Ok.

**JENNY**
They definitely wanted to get out of here. Especially him.

**MCNATTIN**
Mr. Bornsztein?

**JENNY**
Yeah. He was really ... I don't know. Acting weird, I guess.

**MCNATTIN**
And did they say anything? Anything you can remember?

**JENNY**
Well ... they said they'd be home late. He didn't seem too sure when.

**MCNATTIN**
He didn't say?

**JENNY**
He kept changing the time.

**MCNATTIN**
Uh huh ...

**JENNY**
And ... oh! This stood out: he didn't seem like he wanted to promise.

**MCNATTIN**
Promise what?

**JENNY**
Mia ..

**MCNATTIN**
The girl?

**JENNY**
Yeah. Mia asked him to promise he'd be back. And he sorta hesitated. Like, he didn't really want to say it.

**MCNATTIN**
That's interesting. That's really good. Are you sure you remember that?

**JENNY**
Oh yeah. Definitely. She said 'Promise?' and he took a long time to say anything. And then when he did say it, it sounded ... fake? Y'know? Like ...

**MCNATTIN**
... he didn't mean it.

**JENNY**
Yeah. Like he didn't want to say it because ...

**MCNATTIN**
Ok, thanks honey. That's great. Thanks a lot.

MCNATTIN gets up and moves away.

---

## INT. HOUSE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

A SOCIAL WORKER sits with MIA and LEO at the BREAKFAST TABLE. LEO eats SUGARY CEREAL in big mouthfuls. McNATTIN is in the next room.

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Ok guys, here's the deal. Your parents are fine. We just haven't been able to get your dad to pick up his phone.

**MIA**
How do you know they're fine?

**SOCIAL WORKER**
We checked at the museum and no one remembers seeing them there, but that doesn't mean much. There were lots of people at the party.

**MIA**
I don't think they're fine.

**LEO**
*(dribbling cereal milk)*
Mia!

**MIA**
Leo! Don't talk with your mouth full.

**LEO**
*(mouth full)*
I'm not!

**SOCIAL WORKER**
We tried your aunt but it looks like they're on vacation this week. Are you sure there's no one else?

**MIA**
Uh uh.

**LEO**
You could call teacher Amy!

**MIA**
Leooo!

**LEO**
Or. You could call Franko!

**MIA**
Leo! Franko's a kid. They can't call Franko.

**LEO**
Well she could. Call Franko. He has a walkie-talkie.

**MIA**
Ugh.

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Listen. Guys. It's ok. I know you want to help. Don't worry. Your parents are going to be back really soon...

**MIA**
When? When soon?

**SOCIAL WORKER**
*(flustered)*
... and I'm sure there's a really good explanation for all of this. They probably just had a flat tire or something.

**LEO**
*(skeptical)*
A flat tire?

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Yes.

**MIA**
That doesn't make any sense.

**LEO**
*(garbled, with cereal)*
Nope.

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Or. Well. Anyway the police are working on it and I'm sure we'll get through to them really soon.

**MIA**
It wasn't a flat tire.

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Well, something else, then. Nothing bad! I'm sure it was something ...

**MIA**
*(cutting her off)*
It was the storm. That storm did something with them. I know it.

**LEO**
Yeah! And it broke our show.

**MIA**
We were watching a show and suddenly the screen just went...

**LEO (CONT'D)**
*(spilling cereal)*
... poof!

**SOCIAL WORKER**
*(gets a PAPER TOWEL to wipe up the mess)*
Poof?

**MIA**
Uh huh. Poof. And then the lights went out.

**LEO**
Yeah ... all the lights turned off. It was super dark. And scary.

**MIA**
And then my mom's phone started ringing.

**SOCIAL WORKER**
What?

**MIA**
It was just ringing and ringing. We found it under the couch.

**LEO**
I found it!

**MIA**
Leo. We all found it.

**LEO**
Well I saw it first!

**MIA**
No.

**LEO**
Yes!

**MIA**
Uh uh.

**LEO**
Mia!

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Hey Andy! Andy!

Detective McNattin looks up from a phone call in the next room.

**SOCIAL WORKER (CONT'D)**
Can you get over here quick?

**MCNATTIN**
*(aside)*
Hey, lemme call you back, ok?

McNattin walks over.

**SOCIAL WORKER**
These guys say they got a call on the mother's phone.

**MCNATTIN**
Oh yeah?

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Yeah. Last night.

**MCNATTIN**
Really? So? What did they say?

**MIA**
What did who say?

**MCNATTIN**
On the phone. When you picked up. What did they say?

**MIA**
Nothing.

**LEO**
The phone was broken.

**MIA**
We couldn't hear anything. It was just static.

**MCNATTIN**
Where's your mom's phone now?

**MIA**
*(furtively)*
In my room. I kept it in my bed.

**MCNATTIN**
We're going to need to take that.

**MIA & LEO**
No!

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Borrow. He means borrow it. Just to help us find your mommy and daddy.

**MCNATTIN**
*(getting up to get the phone)*
Don't worry, kids. We just need to look at it.

MCNATTIN, leaving.

**MCNATTIN (CONT'D)**
*(aside to another officer)*
Hey, Fred, I think we got a 503 here, can you get Marcia on the phone?

**MIA**
It was the storm.

**LEO**
Poof!

**MIA**
The storm did that to her phone.

**LEO**
Boom!

**SOCIAL WORKER**
It's ok, honey. I know.

**MIA**
They need our help.

**SOCIAL WORKER**
Let's get you guys some extra clothes. We can't let you stay here by yourselves.

Leo looks up from his cereal. Mia looks at him.

---

## INT. JURASSIC CAVE - DAY

The T-REX has bested the other dinosaur and is casually dismembering it, at a safe distance. Nina's inspecting the phone.

**NINA**
It's totally frozen. Nothing works.

**GABE**
*(taking the phone from her)*
Lemme see.

**NINA**
How's that possible?

Gabe taps at the phone. He holds up to his hear and hears only static.

**GABE**
It's just buzzing...

**NINA**
D'you think ... it's still connected?

**GABE**
To what? To when?

**NINA**
Home, I guess. To my phone. Maybe the kids found it.

**GABE**
*(phone to ear)*
All I hear is static. None of the buttons work. It's stuck...

**NINA**
... because it was calling when we went through the portal.

**GABE**
I thought it was a time warp.

Nina gives him a cold, exasperated glare.

**GABE (CONT'D)**
Sorry.

**NINA**
Look. Whatever it was, it brought us here – where there's a dinosaur ...

**GABE**
*(interjecting)*
... two dinosaurs ...

**NINA**
Right. And probably lots more. And if it brought us here, then it can bring us back home.

**GABE**
If it's still there.

**NINA**
It was there. You saw it.

**GABE**
Yeah, it was there. But for how long?

The phone crackles with static. Both look at it. The battery symbol reads 65%.

**NINA**
*(taking the phone)*
We don't have much time.

**GABE**
What are we gonna do? We can't go back out there!

**NINA**
We have to! The kids need us.

**GABE**
There must be another way out.

He turns on his stomach and begins searching.

**NINA**
*(talking into the phone)*
Mia? Leo? Are you there?

INTERCUT WITH:

---

## INT. CAR - DAY

The kids are alone in the back seat of DETECTIVE McNATTIN's car. McNattin is outside. A BARRIER prevents them from getting at the PHONE, which is on the passenger seat.

The phone crackles, and the very faint, static-y sound of Nina's voice is heard, indistinct.

INTERCUT WITH:

---

## INT. JURASSIC CAVE - DAY

**NINA**
*(louder)*
Can you hear me!? I know this sounds crazy ... but last night, in the storm, we went through this portal ... and it took us somewhere.

**GABE**
*(further off)*
Hey look! Honey!

**NINA**
Kids!!

INTERCUT WITH:

---

## INT. CAR - DAY

Now the kids hear the phone and make out the sound of Nina yelling.

**MIA & LEO**
Mom!!! Mommma!!!

But the barrier and static prevent their voices from being heard on the other end. Only a burst of more static.

INTERCUT WITH:

---

## INT. JURASSIC CAVE - DAY

Nina is talking forcefully into the phone. Hopeful and calm at first, but then, starting to break down.

**NINA**
And Leo, there are dinosaurs here, but we're ok! And we're going to get back soon, I promise.

---

## INT. CAR - DAY

Kids still yelling.

At the sound of the kids yelling. McNATTIN comes into the car. He looks back at them skeptically, and starts the engine.

**MCNATTIN**
Alright, here we go.

INTERCUT WITH:

---

## INT. JURASSIC CAVE - DAY

**GABE**
Nina! Over here!

**NINA**
Kids!? Mia!?
*(quietly)*
Leo? Can anyone hear me?
*(crestfallen)*
Ok, I'm coming.

They move down a TUNNEL toward another exit to the CAVE. As they move deeper under the rock, the phone signal gets even weaker and more static-filled, obscuring the voices of the kids...

INTERCUT WITH:

---

## INT. CAR - DAY

... who are still screaming their parents' names inside the police car. McNATTIN, annoyed, puts his finger on a DASHBOARD BUTTON and raises the BARRIER completely, quieting the screaming. Then he presses another button and turns on the RADIO, which plays a COUNTRY SONG.

The song keeps playing over a montage:

PARENTS crawling through muck and tunnels to escape the cave far from where they went in.

The KIDS quieting down in the car. LEO brought a BACKPACK full of snacks.

PARENTS struggling through the strange jurassic environment, crossing a stream, trying to get to higher ground.

KIDS being processed through the social service system, placed in a HOLDING AREA.

Sun getting lower in the jurassic. PARENTS looking for a place to shelter.

---

## INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

DETECTIVE MCNATTIN leads Mia and Leo to a holding room with makeshift sleeping arrangements. They pass a janitor, RUBEN.

**MCNATTIN**
Hey Ruben.

**RUBEN**
Evening.

**MCNATTIN**
We're going to put these guys in the conference room for tonight. I'll sleep in my office.

**RUBEN**
What're they in for?

**MCNATTIN**
Just a little mix-up, that's all.

**RUBEN**
Oh yeah?

**MCNATTIN**
Having trouble getting in touch with mom and dad.

**LEO**
They're coming back soon!

**MIA**
They need our help.

**MCNATTIN**
Alright. You guys stay here for a minute.

McNattin walks to his office across the hall, leaves the phone on the desk, and rifles through a STORAGE CABINET looking for bedding.

Meanwhile, in the CONFERENCE ROOM:

**MIA**
You don't look like a janitor.

**RUBEN**
What's that s'posed to mean?

**LEO**
You look all rumply.

**MIA**
And your bucket's empty.

**RUBEN**
Well ...

**LEO**
Are you a hundred?

**RUBEN**
A hundred? Are you serious?

**MIA**
He's not a hundred, Leo. He's like ... 80. Or 75..

**RUBEN**
Guys!! I'm forty-nine, ok!?

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
*(looks over his shoulder)*
Listen. I gotta tell you something.

He pushes the door closed with his mop.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
I'm not really a janitor, ok. And you can't say a word about this, to anyone ...

The kids look at each other, a little scared.

**MIA**
Ooohhhkay ...?

**LEO**
Are you a robber?

**MIA**
You're a lawyer, right? I knew you looked suspicious...

**LEO**
Are you Darth Vader?!

**RUBEN**
No, no! I'm trying to help you.

*(beat)*
I'm your fairy godfather.

Kids stare blankly for a moment, then both yell at the same time:

**MIA & LEO**
Yaaaaaaay!

McNattin looks up, but keeps on doing his thing.

**RUBEN**
Ssssssh! Stop it!

Kids quiet down.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
I know about your parents; I got a message this morning from upstairs. They had a little mix-up at spacetime control. Someone called in sick and they let one of the interns fill in ...

**MIA**
So it's true! They did go through a portal! We heard mommy on the phone!

**RUBEN**
Yeah, it's true. A time-warp actually. Class three ... pretty good size.

**LEO**
And they found dinosaurs!

**RUBEN**
You could say that.

MCNATTIN finds the bedding, locks NINA'S phone in a cabinet, and begins coming back toward the CONFERENCE ROOM. At the last minute, his PHONE RINGS.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
We don't have much time. Normally, the guys at headquarters close these up real quick, no matter what went through them. Just too risky to leave them. But this is a little different, because of the phone.

**LEO**
Mommy's phone!

**RUBEN**
Yeah, your mommy's phone. It's keeping the portal open ... sorta like a doorstop, see ...

He sticks his mop in the door to hold it open.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
As long as your mom's phone, here, stays connected to your dad's phone, there ...

**MIA**
... the door stays open!

**RUBEN**
Uh huh. But if one of them gets turned off, or runs out of batteries ...

He yanks the mop out of the door and it slams shut.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
So we gotta hurry.

**MIA**
But you're going help us!

**JANITOR**
Yeah. Well, that's the thing. I'm going to try. See, I'm not really ... in top form ... if you know what I mean.

**MIA**
No. I don't. What does that mean, top form?

**LEO**
That means he's broken.

**RUBEN**
I'm kind of ... on the fairy naughty list.

**MIA**
You're a bad fairy? There's a fairy naughty list?

**JANITOR**
*(hurt)*
I'm not a bad fairy!

*(searching for words)*
It's just ... let's say this job is my last chance to get back on the right side of the law. One more screw-up and I lose my wings. And my magic's a little rusty, y'know? Not as handy with the 'old wand as I used to be.
*(waving the mop handle)*

**LEO**
But you do have magic?

**MIA**
And you can help us?

**JANITOR**
I do. And I can. But first we have to –

MCNATTIN has hung up the PHONE and made his way back to the CONFERENCE ROOM.

**MCNATTIN**
*(opening the door, interrupting)*
You guys alright? Ruben here's not scaring you guys, is he?

**LEO**
Yeah, a little!

Awkward pause.

**RUBEN**
No sir! Just told 'em no drooling on my carpet!

MCNATTIN raises an eyebrow.

**MCNATTIN**
Yeah. Anyway. I got sleeping bags. No pillows though.

**MIA**
That's ok. Right Leo?

**LEO**
Right! Because we're going through the time-warp to save mommy and daddy from a tyrannosaurus and get them back home before the batteries run out at the door closes and they're lost forever!

Pause. RUBEN, behind MCNATTIN, tries to wave Leo off from continuing...

**MCNATTIN**
Ohhhhkay... that's ... great? I'll just ... put these here...
*(retreating ...)*
... Let's go, Ruben. These kids need to get a little sleep. Guys, I'm gonna keep this door locked. But don't worry, I'm right over there, in my office. If you need me, just press this button.
*(points out a button on the phone/intercom)*
I'll come get you up in the morning.

**RUBEN**
Alright, chief. I'll see you later.

**MCNATTIN**
Goodnight, Ruben. Goodnight, kids. You'll see; this'll all get sorted out in the morning. Your folks are going to be just fine...

MCNATTIN locks the door. KIDS settle into their sleeping bags. MCNATTIN tries to get comfortable in his office chair. RUBEN walks off.

## EXT. JURASSIC - NIGHT

Gabe and Nina walk through the jungle. They see a huge tree with ladder-like branches and begin climbing it. Night falling.

**NINA**
I should've changed shoes ...

**GABE**
Really? I like those.

**NINA**
I mean, for this.

**GABE**
Oh. Well, you didn't know, obviously.

**NINA**
I didn't even want to go.

**GABE**
What do you mean? I thought you loved the spring gala?

**NINA**
NO! I hate those parties. It's nothing but small talk and bad cocktails.

**GABE**
You do? I mean, I do too! I thought you liked going out!

**NINA**
With you, I do. With the kids. But the work stuff; the fundraisers ... the spring gala! I'm just tired of it. We're so busy lately we never get to spend time together, as a family.

**GABE**
*(holding back a branch)*
Watch out.

**NINA**
And then this happens and I ... I ...
*(choked up)*
... I really miss them.

**GABE**
Oh honey ... come here.
*(he hugs her)*

**NINA**
*(sobbing)*
What if we never see them again? What if we can't make it back?

The settle in to a protected spot high in the tree where they'll spend the night. The sun is dipping under the horizon. They look out.

**GABE**
We'll make it back. In the morning we'll get a better view. We'll figure out where to go.

**NINA**
But the portal...
*(looking at the phone battery indicator)*
... I don't know if we can wait that long ...

**GABE**
We need to rest. And there's no use going out in the dark. Who knows what's out there.

**NINA**
I hope the kids are ok. In that cave, I kind of had a ... feeling ... like I could hear them ... or they could hear me.

**GABE**
I'm sure they're fine. They're probably at your sister's...

**NINA**
*(getting sleepy)*
If we make it back home, I want things to be different.

**GABE**
*(snuggling up)*
Yeah. Me too.

**NINA**
I want us to stop working so much. Take a road trip. Travel more...

**GABE**
We will, honey. When we make it home, we'll pull the kids out of school. I'll take a break, or quit if I have to, and we'll be together. All of us.

**NINA**
Promise?

**GABE**
Promise.

They drift off, exhausted. The phone battery indicator ticks down.

## INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The kids are asleep in the conference room. Detective McNattic sleeps precariously on his office chair. RUBEN THE FAIRY GODFATHER creeps down the hallway with his mop and bucket, wheels squeaking.

**RUBEN**
*(to the bucket, whispering)*
Quiet!

He rolls along a little further. The wheel keeps squeaking.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Ugghh.

He stops, pulls the MOP out, turns it around and points the handle at the wheel.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Blippity goop!

Nothing happens.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Slippity doob!

The mop shudders and zaps the wheel. Rather than fixing the squeak, the wheel disappears, and the the bucket tilts to one side, loudly.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Ahhrgh!

Reaching the conference room, he taps on the glass.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Pssst. Hey! Wake up.

The kids don't stir. He points the mop at an office chair.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Couppla drum!

The chair shifts slightly.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
C'mon... c'mon...

The chair rolls further and gently bumps into sleeping LEO, who stirs awake.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
*(raising his hands, and the mop up triumphantly)*
YES!

The mop zaps a hole in the ceiling tiles, sprinkling dust on cringing RUBEN. McNattin stirs but doesn't wake up.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
*(through the glass)*
Hey ... kid! Over here! You gotta get up!

LEO is fully awake now and notices RUBEN. He nudges MIA.

**LEO**
Mia! Mia wake up!

**MIA**
Huh?

**LEO**
It's the fairy!

**MIA**
Who?

**LEO**
The fairy godfather! That old guy?

**MIA**
Oh!
*(bolts upright)*
He's back! Let's go!

They go over to the door. Ruben motions for them to stand back. He points his wand at the lock.

**RUBEN**
Rugula vorsteen, frabula jin!

The deadbolt flies open, spinning way too far, and the whole apparatus jams.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Oh, come on!

**MIA**
That didn't work.

**LEO**
*(taking his fingers out of his ears)*
That was cool!

Ruben, losing confidence, tries again. This time a feeble zap comes out but nothing at all happens. The kids are still stuck.

**MIA**
Seriously?

The kids search around and settle on the rolling office CHAIR. They line it up and get set for a running start.

**MIA (CONT'D)**
One ... two ...

**MIA & LEO (CONT'D)**
... three!

They run at the CHAIR. LEO jumps on and MIA keeps pushing. They ram the DOOR, which pops open. The noise nearly wakes MCNATTIN. LEO grabs his SNACK-BACKPACK and they walk out.

**RUBEN**
Nice work. But keep it down!

**MIA**
You came back! Are you going to help us?

**LEO**
Let's go get mommy and daddy!

**RUBEN**
We need to get back to the portal. But we need the phone first.

**MIA**
Where is it?

**RUBEN**
The phone?

**MIA**
No, the portal!

**RUBEN**
I don't know! That's why we need the phone. It's connected to your parents. It'll lead us there.

**LEO**
*(pointing at the OFFICE CABINET)*
He put it in there...

All three look past sleeping MCNATTIN to the CABINET.

**MIA**
Let's go.

Leo and Ruben wait in the hall while Mia crawls into the office as quiet as she can. She makes it to the DESK and reaches up for the KEYS.

MCNATTIN stirs and a PILE OF PAPERS falls on the ground, making it impossible to crawl quietly. MIA is stuck.

**LEO**
I'll go!

Leo crawls off, avoiding the PAPERS. Mia hands him the KEYS. He unlocks the CABINET but can't reach the PHONE. He turns and shrugs.

**MIA**
*(whispering to RUBEN)*
What now?

**RUBEN**
I don't know!

**MIA**
Can't you do something?

**RUBEN**
I ... I ...

**MIA**
You have to try!

**RUBEN**
*(sighs)*
Ok, here goes ...
Tippitty toppetty shoo!

Instead of bringing the PHONE down to LEO, the spell zaps MCNATTIN'S PHONE, which start ringing loudly. MCNATTIN wakes up, startled, and answers it.

**MCNATTIN**
Hello? Hello?

He puts his feet down on the CRUMPLY PAPERS.

**MCNATTIN (CONT'D)**
What's going on in here?

He sees MIA, crawling, and RUBEN, outside the door with his MOP pointed at him. He turns and sees LEO, frozen in front of the CABINET.

**MCNATTIN (CONT'D)**
What are you guys doing?

**MIA**
Ruben, do something!

**RUBEN**
I can't!

MIA crawls over to LEO and hoists him up.

**MCNATTIN**
Do something? What are you talking about? What are you doing in my ...

**LEO**
Ruben!!!!!

**MCNATTIN**
*(standing up)*
Ok, whatever's going on, I'm putting a stop to it right now.

LEO reaches the CELL PHONE.

**MIA**
Hurry!!!!!

**MCNATTIN**
*(to Leo)*
Gimme that!

MCNATTIN lunges for the kids.

**RUBEN**
Stropulo bingalup stop!

The MOP shoots a strong ZAP OF MAGIC at MCNATTIN, who is completely frozen in his tracks.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
It worked?

**MIA**
You did it!

**LEO**
Stropula bingulo zap! Stropula bingulo zap!

**RUBEN**
*(to himself, stunned, quietly)*
It really worked!

**LEO**
*(poking MCNATTIN)*
Is he dead?

**MIA**
His eyes are open.

**RUBEN**
He's fine. Just ... stuck there for a little while. I'm not sure how long, actually ...
*(to himself)*
What's the working time for stropulas ... ten minutes?

**MIA**
Now what? Can you zap us to the time-warp?
*(closing her eyes, preparing to be teleported)*
C'mon Leo, get ready ...

Leo balls up his fists at his side and squeezes his eyelids shut too (but can't help peeking out of one)

**RUBEN**
No no, cut it out. I can't do that kind of stuff. At least, not with this thing ...
*(motioning to this mop/wand)*
Fortunately, we don't need it.

**MIA**
Why not?

**RUBEN**
'Cause we have that ...
*(pointing to phone)*
See those bars? The stronger they get, the closer we are to the portal. We just need to follow your mom's phone ...

**MIA**
Let's go!

The kids run off down the hallway. Ruben trails behind pushing his wobbly MOP BUCKET. Before they reach the elevator, DETECTIVE MCNATTIN comes out of his freeze, sees them, and gives chase, lunging and shivering.

**RUBEN**
Uh oh.

**MIA**
*(running)*
I thought you said ten minutes?!

**RUBEN**
I don't know!? I'm a little rusty, ok?

**MIA**
*(to Leo)*
Press the button!

Leo presses the 'down' button. All three wait anxiously as McNattin groggily comes toward them.

**MCNATTIN**
*(into his walkie talkie)*
I've got a 735 here. Two minors and one adult male, age 65 or 70...

**RUBEN**
Oh cmon!

The doors open and they rush in. The doors close at the last moment, shutting McNattin out.

McNattin starts rushing down the stairs, stumbling.

The elevator opens on the first floor and the kids and Ruben run out.

**MIA**
C'mon!!!

**LEO**
Which way!?

**MIA**
*(bursting through the exterior doors)*
Over here!

**RUBEN**
Hurry!

Sirens drone in the distance. McNattin is almost down the stairs.

All three are outside, wondering what to do next. Mia spins and checks the phone bars.

**MIA**
I think it's ...

MCNATTIN finally reaches the LOBBY.

**MCNATTIN**
Hey!! Stop right there!

**MIA**
*(spinning)*
... over ...

**MCNATTIN**
Stay away from that car!

**MIA**
...there!

They run for MCNATTIN'S POLICE CRUISER and jump in.

**MIA (CONT'D)**
Wait a second!
*(to RUBEN)*
You aren't going to drive?!

**LEO**
I'll do it!

**MIA**
Leo! You can't drive a police car!

**LEO**
I can!

**RUBEN**
I can't!

**MIA**
What?!

**RUBEN**
I mean, I can. I just ... got my license revoked, ok? I'm not supposed to. It's against the rules. Fairies can't break the law.

**MIA**
But kids can?!

**RUBEN**
Well, yes. Actually.

**MIA**
Fine. Leo, c'mon.

LEO sits on her lap. MCNATTIN is running through the LOBBY yelling.

**LEO**
Hit it!

Mia slams the gas pedal. Nothing happens.

**RUBEN**
Seriously?

The kids shrug: "what?"

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
You need to start it first!!

**MIA**
How do we do that!

**RUBEN**
Easy.

He points the mop at the ignition.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Magic.

He smashes the end of the mop into the ignition and the car jumps to life. They tear off down the parking lot, driving over curbs.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Now there's a trick that never gets rusty.

---

## EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

They drive around, searching for the time-warp, which is near their home. Police backup arrives at the parking lot and picks up McNattin. They chase the kids. Lots of typical kids-driving-a-car stuff. As they get closer to the portal the signal improves, and with that, the sound of their screaming and loud crashes starts to come through to GABE'S PHONE.

---

## EXT. JURASSIC - TREE

GABE stirs. He wakes up and hears the phone crackling and what sounds like voices. Confused, he listens closer and realizes it's the kids.

**GABE**
Mia! Leo! Guys! Can you hear me! It's daddy!

NINA wakes up.

**NINA**
What's going on?

**GABE**
It's them! I can hear them! It sounds like ... police sirens?

NINA hears MIA'S voice over the static-y signal: "Hurry, they're getting closer!" (or similar)

**NINA**
Sweetie! Baby! It's mommy!

---

## EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The chase resolves and the KIDS and RUBEN jump out of the SMASHED CAR and continue on foot. They are very close to the portal now, and they finally hear their PARENTS on the PHONE.

**MIA**
Mommy!

**NINA**
Mia!

**MIA (CONT'D)**
Mommy we're coming to save you!

**NINA**
Oh honey, are you guys ok? Where are you?

**GABE**
What's that noise!?

**MIA**
We're fine! We just need to find the time-warp so we can help you get back before the phone dies!

LEO grabs the PHONE.

**LEO**
Mommy! I drove a police car! We crashed into a tree!

**GABE**
What?!

**MIA**
This way!

**LEO**
And Ruben is helping us! He's our fairy godfather.

**RUBEN**
*(over the shoulder)*
Nice to meet you folks. Nice kids you got ...

**LEO**
He helped us steal the police car!

**RUBEN**
Not steal! Not steal! Borrow!

Mia spots the TIME-WARP.

**MIA**
There!

**LEO**
I see it!

**GABE**
Wait! Kids. Stop! It's too dangerous!

**MIA**
Daddy?

**GABE**
Mia! You can't! You gotta stay there.

The police turn a corner.

**MIA**
But what if you can't get back!??

**GABE**
I ... I ...

**MIA**
No. We're coming to get you.

**RUBEN**
We're out of time!

**GABE**
Mia - promise me you'll be careful! Promise?

**MIA**
Dad.

**GABE**
Mia!

**MIA**
I promise, dad.

**LEO**
Here we go!!!

**RUBEN**
Wait! The phone! It's holding the portal open ... you need to leave it here!

**MIA**
*(looks around)*
Where?!

**LEO**
Over there!

They stash the phone in some bushes.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
Let's go!

**MIA**
One ...

**LEO**
Two ...

**RUBEN/ALL**
Three!

---

## EXT. JURASSIC SWAMP - DAWN

Leo, Mia, and Ruben jump into the PORTAL and are transported back in time. The materialize in the SWAMP near the CRUSHED CAR.

Nearby is the WEIRD/CUTE CREATURE; he observes them from his nest, then comes out to meet them.

**LEO**
Hey! Look, Mia! It's a puppy!

**MIA**
I don't think that's a puppy.

**LEO**
It's a dinosaur puppy! Chicken. I think he likes me!

**RUBEN**
He's kinda ...

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
... cute.

**MIA**
...disgusting?

Leo reaches out to the creature, who approaches curiously and befriends him.

**LEO**
His name is ... his name is ... JETPLANE!

**MIA**
Jetplane?

**RUBEN**
Makes sense to me.

**LEO**
C'mere, little Jetplane! C'mere!

JETPLANE licks Leo's hand.

**MIA**
So, how are we going to find mom and dad?

**LEO**
Look what happened to their car!

**RUBEN**
Whatever did that must've been huge.

Mia and Ruben inspect the damage. Mia looks up to see a sort of giant nest of branches atop the car. She furrows her brow, curious, and moves closer.

Jetplane starts 'barking' (more like a cross between a chicken sound and a cough) and trying to get Leo's attention.

**LEO**
What? What is it, boy?

**RUBEN**
It's crushed!

**MIA**
What's this thing on top?
*(she starts climbing on the hood to get a look)*
It's so ... weird looking ...

As Mia approaches, Jetplane continues freaking out. Suddenly, a piercing shriek is heard overhead. At the same moment, Mia reaches the nest and sees an enormous egg inside.

**MIA (CONT'D)**
Um... wait...

**RUBEN**
I think you should get down from there.

**LEO**
Mia!

A PTERODACTYL swoops in from the skies. Mia jumps down from the car and backs away just as it crashes in for a landing, rocking the whole vehicle and crunching its strong talons into the metal. It stares at them and lets out a terrifying shriek.

The kids and Ruben back away instinctively. Jetplane runs to the edge of the clearing and barks for them to follow him. The mamma bird steps closer, protecting her nest. Above, the daddy bird's shriek announces his arrival.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
Mia, c'mon! This way!

They turn to flee, following Jetplane's lead through the dense forest, just as the other PTERODACTYL arrives and swoops toward them. But with the forest cover, he can't keep up, so they escape.

Once in safety, they catch their breaths.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
He was trying to help us!
*(leaning down to pet Jetplane)*
Good boy! Good chicken-puppy!

**MIA**
Do you think he knows where Mom and Dad are?

**RUBEN**
Maybe. My guess is whatever crushed their car tried to crush them too...

**LEO**
Hey!

**RUBEN**
Sorry. I mean, they probably had to get out there fast, like we did.
*(nodding at Jetplane)*
He might have seen them.

Jetplane is panting and seems ill-at-ease. He's hungry and thirsty.

**MIA**
I think he's thirsty...

**LEO**
I brought some chocolate milk!

**MIA**
Milk? Leo! That's gross! It's gonna be all warm and disgusting by now.

**LEO**
Well ... I don't care.
*(he unscrews the cap and sniffs it: totally spoiled, he recoils)*
... it's ... fine.

He reaches down to give some to Jetplane, who laps it tentatively at first, then greedily because he loves it. He licks out the little curdled chunks and chews on them.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
See!

**MIA**
Ugh! Gross.

**RUBEN**
Makes sense to me.

Now Jetplane sniffs at Leo's backpack.

**LEO**
You hungry, buddy?

Leo rummages around in the pack and pulls out an apple. Jetplane sniffs it.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
Here, try this.

Jetplane takes a tiny bite, then a larger one. He nearly vomits in disgust and goes into a coughing/squawking fit.

**RUBEN**
Nope.

**MIA**
Oh come on.

**RUBEN**
What else you got?

**LEO**
Um... sour patch kids?
*(he tears open a bag and offers one up)*
Here you go, buddy. Try a blue one ...

Jetplane goes insane with delight at this candy.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
Hey likes it!
*(to Jetplane)*
You like it! How about a red?

**MIA**
Wow. Nice work, Leo.

**RUBEN**
That's amazing. Is he ok? Leo?

Leo keeps giving him candy.

**LEO**
... you want a blue again? Yeah?

**RUBEN**
... um ... Leo? Maybe, let's just ... not give him too many. You know?

**LEO**
Oh, right. Ok.
*(to Jetplane)*
That's enough, little guy. Good boy! Do you think you can show us where mommy and daddy went?

Jetplane purrs (a gross gargling chicken sound), and rubs against Leo's leg.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
Y'know? From. The. Car? The man and the lady. From. THE!? CAR!?

**MIA**
Leo. He can't understand you. He's a dinosaur, remember?

**LEO**
Well ... you don't know.

JETPLANE sniffs around a bit and then stiffens. He trots off, pausing to make sure the others will follow him.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
See! C'mon!

They follow.

---

## EXT. JURASSIC FOREST - DAY

Mia, Leo, Ruben, and Jetplane are walking single file along a path. Jetplane goes last.

**MIA**
Ewww! Leo!

**LEO**
What?

**MIA**
It smells terrible!

**LEO**
It wasn't me!

**MIA**
Leo.

**LEO**
I'm telling the truth!

**MIA**
Ugh.

**LEO**
Seriously!

**RUBEN**
*(from the front of the line)*
Guys ...

**MIA**
You're gross, Leo, you know that?

**LEO**
You're gross!

From the back, Jetplane rips a loud fart. They all turn around.

**RUBEN**
Look!

They all turn to see Jetplane's colored fart plume rising up into the air.

**LEO**
Wow! He farts colors!

**MIA**
I'm never eating sour patch kids again.

**LEO**
Told you it wasn't me.

**MIA**
*(nose pinched, imitating)*
Told you it wasn't me...

**RUBEN**
Look at that!

**MIA**
We're looking! We're looking!

**RUBEN**
No ... I mean ... Leo, what colors did you give him?

**LEO**
Blue ... and red ... and blue...

**MIA**
*(unpinching, pointing at the plumes)*
Blue ... then red ... then blue!

**RUBEN**
That's amazing!

At this Jetplane perks up, proudly, making a satisfied sound.

**LEO**
*(patting him)*
Good boy, Jetplane!

**MIA**
Well ... it's just farts.

**LEO**
*(protective)*
Hey, you're making him feel bad!

**RUBEN**
No, I mean, we can use them!

**LEO**
Use ... the farts?

**RUBEN**
Yes! Exactly! Use the farts!

**LEO**
*(understanding)*
To help find mom and dad!

**RUBEN**
Right!

**MIA**
What are you guys talking about?

**LEO**
Mia! Mom and dad are around here somewhere, right?

**MIA**
Right ...

**LEO**
But we can't see them ...

**MIA**
... and they can't see us ...

**LEO**
... unless we give them something to look for ...

**MIA**
... like a trail ...

**LEO**
Right!

**MIA**
... of Jetplane's farts?

Jetplane makes a questioning sound. Even he's a little confused by this.

**RUBEN**
It's worth a shot!

**LEO**
C'mere, buddy! Want another one?

Leo gets another piece of candy from the bag and feeds it to the creature.

**MIA**
But we can't just stay here.
*(looking around)*
It's too dangerous.

**RUBEN**
She's right, we need to keep moving.

**MIA**
Can't you turn something around here into a carriage? Like, a pumpkin?

**RUBEN**
A pumpkin?

**MIA**
I don't know! A rock or something?!

Jetplane starts farting again. They continue.

---

## EXT. JURASSIC TREE - DAY

Gabe and Nina legs swing over the edge of a huge, vine-riddled branch. We pull up behind them as they look out over the misty landscape in the morning light. They're dirty, damp, ragged, and hungry.

**GABE**
I can't believe we let them go through that thing...

**NINA**
Let them?

**GABE**
We should've hung up the phone...

**NINA**
It doesn't work.

**GABE**
Or smashed it, or something.

**NINA**
What are you talking about?

**GABE**
I'm saying the phone is holding that time-warp open! And we should've closed it before the kids went through. OK? That's what we should've done.

**NINA**
Do you hear what you're saying? You would've trapped us here. There'd be no way back.

**GABE**
I know.

**NINA**
And you're good with that? You think that's just fine?! Abandoning our kids ... forever?

**GABE**
Is this any better? Now they're here, and the battery's going to run out soon anyway, and then we'll all be stuck here...
*(despondent)*
... together. We should've stopped them. We should've protected them.

**NINA**
Stop it! Stop!

Nina gets up and leans against the trunk of the tree.

You heard what they said. They're just little kids ... you know how scared they must be? What they're going through? And they're the ones coming to get us!

She points out into the vast jungle.

They're the ones out there, walking through that jungle, filled with god-knows-what.

We can't give up on them, Gabe. We need to find them and get home ... together. You promised her, remember? You promised ... that was the last thing you said before we ...

**GABE**
Look!

**NINA**
... left.

**GABE (INTERRUPTING):**
*(pointing left)*
That way ... on the left! Way out there. On the other side of the river! See it?

Gabe points toward the distant smoke plumes.

**GABE**
Do you see that? Blue and red?

**NINA**
What ... is that?

---

## EXT. JURASSIC - RIVER - DAY

Gabe and Nina have descended the tree and are making their way along a high river bluff. They can see the plumes rising in the distance.

**GABE**
It's gotta be!

**NINA**
Are you sure? What if it's something else?

**GABE**
I don't know. We'll have to take the chance. But I think they're trying to send us a signal ...

**NINA**
Well, I guess we don't have much of a choice.

Nina shows him the phone. The battery is even lower.

**GABE**
Let's go. We gotta hurry.

They keep moving.

---

## EXT. CANYON'S EDGE - DAY

Mia, Leo, and Ruben reach a huge canyon. The parents approach on the other side.

**MIA**
Oh great. Now what? We're gonna die.

**RUBEN**
That's the spirit.

**LEO**
*(Spots parents)*
Look! Mommy! Daddy!

**MIA**
Mamma!!! Over here!!

Nina and Gabe are out of earshot but recognize the kids.

---

## EXT. OPPOSITE CANYON'S EDGE

**NINA**
They're OK!!!

**GABE**
They're here! I can't believe it! They made it!

**NINA**
What are we going to do?

**GABE**
And what's ... that thing?

**NINA**
They said he was a fairy godfather? They called him Ruben.

**GABE**
No, not him. The little chicken-y thing.

---

## EXT. CANYON'S EDGE

**MIA**
*(to RUBEN)*
What now?

**LEO**
We have to go across.

**MIA**
Leo!

**LEO**
What?!

**MIA**
We know that!

**LEO**
Oh. Well ... Ruben can fly us across! Right?

**RUBEN**
Nope. Don't do flying. Not licensed for it. Totally different skillset.

**LEO**
Super-jumping?

**MIA**
A helicopter? A pumpkin helicopter?

**RUBEN**
What is it with the pumpkins and you guys. Where are you getting that?

No ... but ... lemme see what you've got in that backpack.

Leo opens the backpack and pulls items out. The candy, the chocolate milk carton, a box of crayons.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
There! Gimme those. Now we need rope. String. Something like that.

**MIA**
I have a hair binder?

**RUBEN**
Perfect!

She hands it over.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Now, you guys stay really still for a minute.

He does a spell and waves his mop and creates a rope and crayon bridge spanning the canyon.

**LEO**
Woah! Awesome!

**RUBEN**
*(tugging his suspenders)*
Voila!

Immediately a few crayon slats, cracked, crumble and fall into the void, noiselessly.

**LEO**
... not awesome. Not awesome. I'll stay here with Jetplane. You guys go.

**MIA**
Leo! No way. We have to stick together. Look, it's not that bad ... I'll go first.

Mia carefully edges out onto the bridge, then goes further. Ruben goes next.

**RUBEN**
*(admiring his handiwork)*
Not bad, if I do say so myself. Not bad at all.

Jetplane charges ahead, completely unafraid, and scoots by Mia and Ruben to the front.

**MIA**
Come on!

Leo finally musters up the courage to go and trails behind slowly and tentatively.

Jetplane reaches the other side first, then Mia, then Ruben. Leo is near the end when a big gust of wind comes and knocks him off balance.

The crayon he's standing on is cracked, and begins to break. He loses his footing. He falls through, hanging on to the bridge for his life.

Everyone screams, but before they can do anything, the crayon he's holding gives out and he falls.

**MIA (CONT'D)**
Leo!!!!

Leo falls down the canyon, but suddenly his fall is stopped when Ruben does a magic spell. He's suspended near the side of the cliff, out of reach.

**MIA (CONT'D)**
Ruben! Can you bring him up?

**RUBEN**
*(extreme effort)*
I'm trying!

Ruben begins exerting himself, trying to lift Leo out. But he can't do more than keep him from falling.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
It's no use! I told you ... I don't ... do ... flying! ... I can't hold him long!

It looks like Leo will fall, when at the last moment, Jetplane shoots a hideously long tongue down. It's slobbery and slimy.

**LEO**
Argh!
*(grabs it anyway)*
Ugh.

Jetplane is pulled forward by the weight as Leo grabs on. He slides straight for the edge of the clif, mouth wide open, tongue out, but RUBEN and MIA catch him. NINA and GABE pitch in. They pull him up slowly. He reaches the top, is saved, and all are exhausted.

**NINA**
Come here!

The family hugs.

**MIA**
Mommy! I love you! We were so scared!

**NINA**
I know, honey. It's ok.

**GABE**
That was close.
*(to RUBEN)*
You must be ...

**RUBEN**
Ruben Romanovsky. C-class, licensed and bonded professional fairy Godfather. Great to meet you.

Gabe shakes his hand.

**NINA**
*(toward JETPLANE)*
And this?

**LEO**
His name is Jetplane! He's my friend!

**NINA**
He's ... a?

**MIA**
Dinosaur. A chicken-puppy-lizard ... or something.

**LEO**
He farts colors!

**GABE**
So that's what that was!! That's how we found you guys!

**MIA**
They smell worse than they look.

**RUBEN**
Listen ... we need to get moving.
*(to NINA)*
Do you have the phone?

Nina takes it out. They all huddle over it. The low battery alert comes up.

**MIA**
There's no time! It's about to run out!

**NINA**
What are we going to do?!

**GABE**
We have to go back ... c'mon!

He starts leading everyone toward the rope bridge, but before they can get it on, the whole thing collapses.

**MIA**
Noooo!

She crumbles to her knees, despondent.

**LEO**
Now what do we do?

**RUBEN**
Um, guys?

Gabe grabs Leo by the hand and starts leading him.

**GABE**
Come on!

No one follows. He stops short and looks back.

**GABE (CONT'D)**
Well!?

**NINA**
Through the cave?!
*(She looks at the phone)*
Are you kidding?!

**RUBEN**
People?

Nina grabs Leo's hand and tries pulls him back.

**NINA**
We don't have enough time, Gabe!

**GABE**
*(pulling on Leo)*
We don't have a choice!

**RUBEN**
Hey!!!

They look at him.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
I'm really not supposed to do this. In fact, I'll probably lose my wings...

**MIA**
Ruben, no!

**RUBEN**
... but it doesn't matter. A fairy godfather's gotta do what a fairy godfather's gotta do.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Everyone: hold hands!

They all link up. Leo scoops up Jetplane.

**RUBEN (CONT'D)**
Let's hope this works!

He slowly waves his mop in spiral, closes his eyes and concentrates with an intensity we haven't seen from his yet.

We pull up to an aerial shot, looking down at them in the clearing.

Imperceptibly, at first, a glowing blue mist materializes around them. His chant increases in volume, the mist flickers with growing strength, and then with a jolt, zaps them away.

We're left CUTTING to a ground-level shot of the damp ground and bits of the blue mist swirling, but everyone is gone!

## EXT. JURASSIC - SWAMP - EVENING

The group approaches the swamp clearing at a run.

**GABE**
There it is! C'mon! We have to hurry!!

**MIA**
How much left?

**NINA**
*(looking at the phone)*
Not much!

**RUBEN**
*(huffing and puffing)*
I'm right behind you! I'm right ... behind ...

**LEO**
C'mon Jetplane!
*(urging him on)*
C'mon little buddy!

They stop abruptly. Gabe spots the portal.

**GABE**
There! Look!

**NINA**
I see it!

**MIA**
Yeah! Let's get out of here!

They start moving again but are immediately stopped. A huge, crashing boom is heard, and then the same T-REX (from before) arrives. It doesn't see them. Jetplane hides behind Leo's leg and growls softly.

**NINA**
Her again!

**MIA**
You know this dinosaur?

**GABE**
We're acquainted.

**NINA**
She's right in front of the time-warp!

**GABE**
We need to go around!

**NINA**
Oh, like the last time!?

**GABE**
What's that supposed to mean?

Parents begin bickering about what to do.

**LEO**
I have an idea.

The parents are arguing and don't listen.

**LEO (CONT'D)**
Hey! What if we ...

**GABE**
Hold on a second, son.

Frustrated, Leo huddles with Mia, whispering his plan. They grab Ruben and tell him what to do. When they're ready, Mia steps out.

**MIA**
Ahem!

No reply.

**MIA (CONT'D)**
Mom! Dad!

Finally the parents stop arguing. The T-REX hears Mia's yelling and looks around for the source.

**GABE**
Sssshhh!

**NINA**
What is it?

**MIA**
*(to LEO)*
Leo: go!

Leo runs into the clearing, yelling to draw attention to himself. Jetplane follows him. The T-REX sees him and roars.

**GABE**
Leo! What are you doing!

**NINA**
Noooo!

The T-REX begins stomping toward LEO.

**MIA**
It's ok. Just watch!

**NINA**
*(looking at the phone)*
I think we're out of time, guys! We have to go now!

Leo taunts the big dinosaur.

**MIA**
One second ...

**GABE**
This is crazy. This is ... crazy!

He runs out into the clearing.

**GABE (CONT'D)**
Hey! Hey! Over here! You want him? You're gonna have to come through me first!

T-REX roars and starts running at GABE.

**MIA**
Dad! No!

Gabe starts running toward the T-REX. Closer, and closer ...

**MIA (CONT'D)**
*(to Ruben)*
Now!

**RUBEN**
*(points his mop at Jetplane)*
Trangala yaris, dibitty saurus!

A zap of energy shoots out and hits Jetplane, who is stunned, and then shrinks to half his size.

**MIA**
Ruben!!!!

**RUBEN**
Ahh! I don't know!!

**NINA**
Gabe!

Gabe and the dino move even closer together. Finally reaching each other, and Gabe's certain death, when ...

**RUBEN**
Bigitty saurus! Bigitty saurus!

Suddenly Jetplane bursts up to a giant size, even bigger and scarier than the T-REX. Everything stops as the dinosaur realizes. Gabe is frozen.

**LEO**
Jetplane?

Jetplane!!!! Attack!!

Jetplane is a little confused at first, but then realizes his huge size and power advantage and gleefully moves to scare off the T-REX. He does a giant-size version of his weird chicken-gargle thing and lashes out his enormous tongue. The T-REX is horrified.

Jetplane stomps toward the dinosaur who has no choice but to retreat, and then run away.

**MIA**
Yeah! You did it!

**RUBEN**
I did it?

**LEO**
Way to go!

**RUBEN**
I did. Didn't I?

**NINA**
*(looking at the phone!)*
C'mon!

The phone flashes a screen that says "Your battery is drained, your device will shut down in 10, 9, 8 ..."

**NINA (CONT'D)**
Run!!!!!!

They all run toward the portal. Gabe gets there first, he ushers Mia in.

**GABE**
You first!

**MIA**
But dad!

**GABE**
I'm right behind you!

**LEO**
What about him?
*(pointing to huge Jetplane)*

**RUBEN**
It'll wear off.

**LEO**
That's what I'm worried about!

**NINA**
We don't have time!

**GABE**
He'll be ok. We need to go!

He pushes the kids through, then Nina, the Ruben goes, finally Gabe takes a look around and jumps through, just as the portal starts to close.

---

## EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The group appears back in the street, stunned. Nearby is a lone police cruiser left behind to watch the site. It's cordoned off with police tape.

**MIA**
*(getting up off the ground)*
We did it! I can't believe it!

**GABE**
*(dusting himself off)*
That was too close.
*(addressing Leo like he might be angry at him)*
And Leo!!

A little pause.

**GABE (CONT'D)**
... You were amazing! Way to go!

They all hug.

---

## INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

The POLICE OFFICER shakes awake.

**OFFICER**
Huh?!

Static on the CB radio.

**OFFICER (CONT'D)**
Is that ...? How did ...
*(into the radio)*
This is 4278, Officer Jackson. I'm here at Oak and Lyndale and I think I got a 10-20 on that missing family? Two adults, two juveniles? One ... janitor, I think?

**CB OPERATOR**
*(scratchy)*
Copy that. You have five individuals?

**OFFICER**
Affirmative.

**CB OPERATOR**
You need any back up there, 4278?

**OFFICER**
*(getting out of the car)*
No ... I think I'm ok ...

He draws the last word out as he sees ...

---

## EXT. STREET - NIGHT

JETPLANE comes bursting out of the TIMEWARP at the very last moment, as it collapses. Family doesn't notice him, and he quietly walks up behind them. Meanwhile, police officer is frantic and calling for backup. He steps out of the car, pointing a bullhorn.

**OFFICER**
Stand back!! Move away!!

**GABE**
Huh?

**NINA**
No, they're with us! We're the parents!

**RUBEN**
Not me.

**OFFICER**
Step! Away! From! The Monster!

**RUBEN**
Hey!

Officer reaches into the car and turns on the siren. This jolts Jetplane, who whimpers. Now everyone sees him.

**LEO**
Jetplane!
*(hugging his leg)*
You're safe!!

**RUBEN**
You're ... still huge!?

Other squad cars start arriving, lights and sirens blaring. Detective McNattin shows up and starts barking orders. The situation is getting dangerous and more intense.

**MCNATTIN**
*(grabbing the bullhorn)*
Stand down! Stand down!

**LEO**
He's scared!

**MCNATTIN**
*(walking out toward the group)*
We're not going to hurt you!

Jetplane, agitated, begins gargle-roaring and appearing more menacing. He shoots his tongue out and bashes the lights out on one of the cars. McNattin is knocked over, retreats, and signals to the other cops to prepare to fire.

**MCNATTIN (CONT'D)**
We gotta take that thing out.

**GABE**
*(to police)*
He's ok!! Turn the lights off! Don't shoot!

**LEO**
Jetplane! Sshh... easy boy!

**MIA**
Ruben! Do something! Make them disappear!

**RUBEN**
I can't! Remember!?

**MIA**
What about him!?
*(pointing to Jetplane)*
Remember? Dibitty saurus!?

**RUBEN**
Dibitty ... saurus!
*(remembering, pointing his mop, the police are just about to shoot)*
Trangala yaris ... dibitty ... saurus!!

Jetplane shrinks to chihuahua size. In the confusion that follows, Leo grabs him and hides him in his backpack. The police are confused, bewildered.

**MCNATTIN**
Where'd he go?
*(walking out toward the family)*
Where's the thing!? What happened to him?

**GABE**
Must've gone back home, I guess.

**NINA**
Um... yeah. Back through the portal, right kids?

**MIA**
Yup.

**LEO**
Uh huh.

**MCNATTIN**
*(skeptical)*
Back through "the portal"?

**GABE**
It's actually more of a time-warp.

**LEO**
A wormhole!

**RUBEN**
Singularity?

**MIA**
A tear in the fabric of space time...

From inside the bag, JETPLANE lets out his weird gargle-sound (his contribution to the list). Everyone acts like they didn't hear it.

**MCNATTIN**
Uh ... huh ...

Detective backs away - weirded out - as the family continues geeking out about the portal. We pull out on the scene and

FADE OUT

---

## INT. HOUSE - MORNING

OPEN ON

The sun streams through a kitchen window on a gorgeous morning. The family moves about. Gabe makes pancakes

**GABE**
Kids! Breakfast!

**NINA**
Hey, honey? Are you doing that board meeting tonight?

**GABE**
Nah. Told 'em I couldn't make it. Promised Mia we'd go to the lizard shop.

**MIA**
*(arriving)*
Yesss! Can I get one dad? Can I?!

**NINA**
We'll see honey ...

**MIA**
It's not fair! Leo got one!

**GABE**
I said maybe! Come get something to eat first, and we'll talk about it.

Camera pulling out as Leo arrives.

**LEO**
I want orange juice!

**NINA**
Coming right up!

**MIA**
Can I have whipped cream on mine?

Pulling back through the window, pulling back to aerial shot.

**GABE**
Sure. What about you, little dude? Any pancakes today?

Full aerial shot.

**LEO**
Dad!!

**GABE**
What?!

Colored plumes start coming out the chimney.

**LEO**
I already fed him!

A few more colored plumes, and then ...

CUT TO BLACK

# THE END
