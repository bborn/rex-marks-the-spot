# Dialogue Polish Notes

Review of "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" screenplay for dialogue issues.

---

## Summary

The screenplay has solid fundamentals - character voices are mostly distinct, and the humor lands. Key areas for polish:
- **12 lines flagged as too on-the-nose** (stating theme/plot too directly)
- **5 exposition dumps** to break up or trim
- **3 character voice inconsistencies**
- **2 lines too adult for kids** (minor)

Overall, the dialogue is strong. These are refinements, not rewrites.

---

## On-The-Nose Dialogue

Lines where characters state things that could be shown, implied, or cut.

### 1. Nina's theme statement (Tree Scene, Lines 1202-1204)

**Current:**
> "With you, I do. With the kids. But the work stuff; the fundraisers ... the spring gala! I'm just tired of it. We're so busy lately we never get to spend time together, as a family."

**Issue:** Directly states the movie's theme. "We never get to spend time together as a family" is exactly what the whole adventure is about. Feels like a mission statement.

**Suggested:**
> "With you, sure. With the kids. But the galas and the fundraisers? All these people we don't even know? I don't remember signing up for that."

The "family time" theme emerges naturally through the plot without needing to be stated.

---

### 2. Gabe's resolution speech (Tree Scene, Lines 1251-1260)

**Current:**
> "We will, honey. When we make it home, we'll pull the kids out of school. I'll take a break, or quit if I have to, and we'll be together. All of us."

**Issue:** Too specific and declarative for an emotional moment. Lists concrete actions like a plan rather than an emotional promise.

**Suggested:**
> "We will. I don't care about the job. I don't care about any of it. I just want to get back to them."

Let the "we'll spend more time together" be implied rather than itemized.

---

### 3. Nina explaining the stakes (Cave, Lines 807-816)

**Current:**
> "Look. Whatever it was, it brought us here – where there's a dinosaur..."
> "... two dinosaurs..."
> "Right. And probably lots more. And if it brought us here, then it can bring us back home."

**Issue:** Nina explaining story logic that the audience already understands.

**Suggested:**
> "Gabe, if that thing brought us here, maybe it can bring us back."

One line instead of four. Gabe's interjection about "two dinosaurs" can stay as a tension-breaker.

---

### 4. Gabe's self-blame (Tree, Lines 2205-2219)

**Current:**
> "I'm saying the phone is holding that time-warp open! And we should've closed it before the kids went through. OK? That's what we should've done."

**Issue:** He's restating plot mechanics to his wife who already knows this.

**Suggested:**
> "We should've smashed that phone. Trapped ourselves here. Then at least they'd be safe."

Shows his guilt through an extreme wish rather than explaining mechanics.

---

### 5. Nina countering (Tree, Lines 2213-2219)

**Current:**
> "And you're good with that? You think that's just fine?! Abandoning our kids ... forever?"

**Issue:** "Abandoning our kids forever" is melodramatic phrasing that states the obvious.

**Suggested:**
> "You would've trapped us here. No way back. You understand that?"

More grounded, less soap-opera.

---

### 6. Mia's death line (Canyon, Line 2284)

**Current:**
> "Oh great. Now what? We're gonna die."

**Issue:** Kids rarely talk about dying this casually. Feels more like an adult screenwriter's voice.

**Suggested:**
> "Oh great. Now what?"

Let Ruben's "That's the spirit" land on its own. Or:
> "This is the worst."

---

### 7. Ruben's sacrifice announcement (Canyon, Lines 2540-2546)

**Current:**
> "I'm really not supposed to do this. In fact, I'll probably lose my wings... but it doesn't matter. A fairy godfather's gotta do what a fairy godfather's gotta do."

**Issue:** The cliche "gotta do what I gotta do" undercuts the emotional beat.

**Suggested:**
> "I'm really not supposed to do this. Might be the last spell I ever cast. But hey... what's the point of having wings if you can't use them?"

More character-specific and bittersweet.

---

### 8. Leo's summary line (Lines 1154-1155)

**Current:**
> "Right! Because we're going through the time-warp to save mommy and daddy from a tyrannosaurus and get them back home before the batteries run out at the door closes and they're lost forever!"

**Issue:** This is clearly written for adults to find cute, but no kid talks like this. It's a plot summary disguised as dialogue.

**Suggested:**
> "Right! We're gonna save mommy and daddy!"

Then McNattin's confused reaction still lands without the over-explanation.

---

## Exposition Dumps

Passages where too much information is delivered in one chunk.

### 1. Ruben's fairy HQ explanation (Lines 1055-1061)

**Current:**
> "I know about your parents; I got a message this morning from upstairs. They had a little mix-up at spacetime control. Someone called in sick and they let one of the interns fill in..."

**Issue:** Dense backstory that kids won't track and adults don't need.

**Suggested:**
> "I know about your parents. There was a... situation. Upstairs."
> (beat)
> "Long story. Doesn't matter. What matters is I'm here to help."

The mystery is more interesting than the explanation.

---

### 2. Ruben's phone/portal explanation (Lines 1072-1094)

**Current:** Extended metaphor with the mop-as-doorstop, then explaining how phones work as dimensional anchors.

**Issue:** The visual metaphor is good, but the dialogue around it is over-explained.

**Suggested:** Keep the mop visual, trim the dialogue:
> "As long as your mom's phone and your dad's phone stay connected..."
> (he sticks mop in door)
> "...the door stays open."
> (yanks it out, door slams)
> "So we gotta hurry."

Cut the middle section about "If one of them gets turned off, or runs out of batteries..."

---

### 3. Social Worker's excuses (Lines 591-615)

**Current:** The social worker goes through multiple unconvincing explanations (flat tire, something else, nothing bad) while Mia pokes holes in each one.

**Issue:** Slightly repetitive - the joke lands after one or two exchanges, not four.

**Suggested:** Trim to two exchanges:
> **SOCIAL WORKER:** They probably just had a flat tire or something.
> **MIA:** That doesn't make any sense.
> **SOCIAL WORKER:** Well... anyway, the police are working on it.
> **MIA:** It was the storm.

---

### 4. Jenny's testimony (Lines 506-527)

**Current:** Jenny builds suspicion about Gabe with McNattin encouraging her throughout.

**Issue:** McNattin is too leading ("That's interesting. That's really good.") - feels like he's coaching a witness.

**Suggested:** Less approval from McNattin:
> **JENNY:** And... he didn't really want to promise? Like, it sounded fake.
> **MCNATTIN:** Hm.
> (beat)
> **MCNATTIN (CONT'D):** Thanks, Jenny. That's helpful.

Let the audience catch the implication without McNattin spelling it out.

---

### 5. Ruben's backstory (Lines 1100-1121)

**Current:**
> "It's just ... let's say this job is my last chance to get back on the right side of the law. One more screw-up and I lose my wings. And my magic's a little rusty, y'know? Not as handy with the 'old wand as I used to be."

**Issue:** Lot of setup that could be revealed through action instead.

**Suggested:**
> "Let's just say this job is my last chance. One more screw-up and..."
> (trails off, looks at his mop)
> "Anyway. My magic's a little rusty."

His wings and "fairy naughty list" status can be revealed later through action.

---

## Character Voice Issues

### 1. Ruben's magic words are inconsistent

**Examples:**
- "Blippity goop!" / "Slippity doob!" (early attempts)
- "Rugula vorsteen, frabula jin!" (door spell)
- "Trangala yaris, dibitty saurus!" (size spell)
- "Stropulo bingalup stop!" (freeze spell)

**Issue:** Some are silly/nursery rhyme ("blippity goop"), others are faux-Latin ("rugula vorsteen"). Inconsistent magic system.

**Suggested:** Pick a lane. Either:
- All rhyming/silly: "Blippity gloop, stay in your seat!"
- All faux-Latin: "Portala aperium!"
- All descriptive: "Bigitty-small! Stoppity-freeze!"

The descriptive approach ("dibitty saurus," "bigitty saurus") is working - lean into it consistently.

---

### 2. Leo's vocabulary varies

**Examples:**
- "You could call Franko! He has a walkie-talkie." (age-appropriate)
- "I'll stay here with Jetplane. You guys go." (slightly too composed for 4-5 year old in danger)
- "And Ruben is helping us! He's our fairy godfather." (good)

**Issue:** Leo sometimes sounds 4, sometimes sounds 7.

**Suggested:** Keep Leo in the younger range consistently:
> Instead of: "I'll stay here with Jetplane. You guys go."
> Try: "I don't wanna! It's too scary!"

Let Mia be the brave older sibling who convinces him.

---

### 3. Mia's lawyer joke (Line 1031)

**Current:**
> "You're a lawyer, right? I knew you looked suspicious..."

**Issue:** Precocious joke that might be more adult-writer than 8-year-old Mia. Though some kids do hear lawyer jokes from parents.

**Suggested:** Either keep it (it's borderline acceptable) or replace:
> "You're a secret agent! I knew it!"

More kid-logic while still being funny.

---

## Too Adult for Kids

### 1. "Culvert, whatever" (Line 246)

**Current:**
> **NINA:** Honey, this is NOT a ditch.
> **GABE:** Well. Culvert, whatever.

**Issue:** "Culvert" is an obscure word most adults don't even know. Kids definitely won't.

**Suggested:**
> "Gully, whatever."

Or just cut Gabe's line - Nina's emphasis already lands.

---

### 2. "503" police code (Line 737)

**Current:**
> "Hey, Fred, I think we got a 503 here, can you get Marcia on the phone?"

**Issue:** Real police code for stolen car - won't mean anything to kids.

**Suggested:**
> "Hey, Fred, I think something weird's going on here. Can you get Marcia on the phone?"

The mystery is served without the jargon.

---

## Lines That Work Great

For reference, here are standout moments that nail character voice and kid-appropriate humor:

- **Leo:** "Are you Darth Vader?!" (Line 1034) - Perfect kid logic.
- **Ruben:** "What is it with the pumpkins and you guys. Where are you getting that?" (Line 2353) - Good running gag reference.
- **Leo:** "He farts colors!" (Line 2064) - The movie's thesis statement, appropriately stated.
- **Mia:** "I'm never eating sour patch kids again." (Line 2067) - Great deadpan.
- **Leo:** "Y'know? From. The. Car? The man and the lady. From. THE!? CAR!?" (Lines 2001-2002) - Perfect kid frustration.
- **Ruben:** "Not bad, if I do say so myself. Not bad at all." (Line 2393) - Right before it crumbles. Good timing.
- **Officer:** "One... janitor, I think?" (Line 2817) - Lands well.

---

## Priority Fixes

If time is limited, focus on these 5 changes:

1. **Trim Leo's plot-summary line** (Line 1154) - Most obvious "written by adults" moment
2. **Soften Nina's theme statement** (Lines 1202-1204) - Let the theme emerge naturally
3. **Cut Ruben's HQ backstory** (Lines 1055-1061) - Mystery > exposition
4. **Unify Ruben's magic words** - Pick one style
5. **Replace "culvert"** - Easy fix, no reason to lose kids on a vocab word

---

## Notes for Voice Recording

When recording, watch for:
- **Mia** should sound annoyed but not mean - she loves Leo
- **Leo** should sound younger than the words on the page
- **Ruben** should sound defeated but not pathetic - world-weary, not whiny
- **Gabe** should sound stressed in Act 1, warmer by Act 3
- **Nina** is the heart - should sound scared but never hopeless
