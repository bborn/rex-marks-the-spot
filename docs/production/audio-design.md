# Audio Design Document
## Fairy Dinosaur Date Night

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-04

---

## Overview

This document outlines the complete sound design requirements for "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night." The film's audio landscape spans three distinct sonic worlds: the warm domestic present-day home, the dangerous prehistoric Jurassic era, and the institutional police station. Sound design must seamlessly transition between these worlds while supporting the emotional journey of a family separated by time.

### Audio Pillars

1. **Emotional Warmth** - Home and family scenes need cozy, inviting soundscapes
2. **Prehistoric Danger** - Jurassic scenes require immersive, alien environments
3. **Comic Relief** - Character sounds (especially Jetplane) balance tension with humor
4. **Magic & Wonder** - Portal and spell effects should feel otherworldly yet grounded
