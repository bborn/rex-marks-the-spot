## Recommended Approach for FDDN Trailer

**Rationale:**
1. Access to "Birds of Paradise" and "The Storm" - perfect tone match
2. Pro license covers commercial film trailers
3. Same subscription can be used for the full film score later
4. High-quality alternatives if first choices don't work in edit

**Backup/Free Options:**
- "Epic Cinematic Adventure" from Pixabay for action climax
- "Whimsy Comedy" from Pixabay for comedic beats

---

## Next Steps

1. **Director Decision:** Approve budget for Artlist Pro or use Pixabay-only approach
2. **Listen to Tracks:** Preview recommended tracks against storyboard animatic
3. **Download & Test:** Get stems/variations if available for editing flexibility
4. **Document Usage:** Keep receipts and download records for licensing compliance
