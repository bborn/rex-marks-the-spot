# Rex Marks the Spot - Project Status (Feb 4, 2026)

## Current State

### Assets Complete
- **Storyboards Act 1**: 56 panels (sketch style) ✓
- **Storyboards Act 2**: 89 panels (regenerating with sketch style - in progress)
- **Storyboards Act 3**: 0 panels (needs generation)
- **Environment Art**: 22 pieces across multiple locations
- **Character Concepts**: Folders for all 6 main characters (Gabe, Nina, Mia, Leo, Ruben, Jetplane)
- **Music**: Original score tracks generated
- **First Animated Scene**: INT. HOME - EVENING rendered

### Infrastructure
- Website live at rexmarksthespot.com
- LLM chat widget on all pages
- Storyboard viewer with panel feedback system (just merged PR #51)
- QA validation system for AI-generated assets
- TaskYou remote queue for agent coordination
- Media gallery for production assets

### Open PRs (need review)
- #54 - Fix TV static panel
- #53 - Website copy voice revision
- #52 - Blog post voice revision

### In Progress
- Task #63 - Act 2 storyboard regeneration (running now, ~12 min remaining)

## What's Left for MVP

### Critical Path
1. **Act 3 Storyboards** - 0/~80 panels (blocking overall story visualization)
2. **3D Character Models** - Need rigged models for animation
3. **Scene Assembly** - Combine characters, environments, animations
4. **Animation/Render Pipeline** - Blender automation for scene rendering
5. **Audio Integration** - Voice acting, sound effects, music sync

### Nice to Have
- More environment variety
- Character turnarounds and expression sheets
- Animatic (storyboards with timing/audio)

## Recommended Next Tasks

### Today (Feb 4)
1. ✓ Finish Act 2 storyboard regeneration (in progress)
2. Review and merge open PRs (#52, #53, #54)
3. Generate Act 3 storyboards (sketch style)
4. Write Feb 4 blog post

### This Week
1. Start 3D character model generation (Tripo AI or Meshy)
2. Test Blender scene assembly with placeholder characters
3. Create animatic for Act 1 (storyboards + timing + scratch audio)
4. Review storyboard feedback and iterate on flagged panels

### Blockers/Decisions Needed
- Which AI tool for 3D character generation? (Tripo vs Meshy vs Rodin)
- Animation style: Full 3D or 2.5D with moving storyboards?
- Voice acting: Generate now or wait for locked edit?
