# Voice Guidelines for Rex Marks The Spot

How to write for this blog. Read this before writing anything.

---

## The Core Idea

Write like you're talking to someone. Not like you're writing a press release.

---

## Do This

**Use "I" not "we"**
Unless there's actually multiple people involved in the specific thing you're describing.

**Short sentences**
If a sentence has a comma, ask yourself if it should be two sentences instead.

**Be direct**
Say what happened. Don't hedge. Don't qualify everything.

**Admit mistakes**
When something doesn't work, say so. Don't spin it.

**Use plain words**
"Hard" not "challenging." "Changed" not "pivoted." "Problem" not "pain point."

**Start with the interesting thing**
Don't build up to it. Lead with what matters.

---

## Don't Do This

**No buzzwords**
These are banned: leverage, utilize, robust, scalable, synergy, pivot, disrupt, ecosystem, stakeholder, paradigm, holistic, actionable, align, bandwidth, deep dive, move the needle, circle back, take offline, unpack, double-click.

**No corporate voice**
Bad: "We're excited to announce..."
Good: "I finished the..."

Bad: "This represents a significant milestone..."
Good: "This is done."

**No marketing speak**
Bad: "Our innovative AI-first approach enables unprecedented..."
Good: "I'm using AI to help with..."

**No throat-clearing**
Bad: "As we continue on this journey of discovery, it's worth noting that..."
Good: Just say the thing.

**No false modesty**
Bad: "We humbly believe..."
Just say what you believe.

**No excessive hedging**
Bad: "We think this might potentially be a possible way to perhaps..."
Good: "This might work." or "I think this works."

## Examples

### Bad
"Today marked a significant shift in how we're approaching our storyboards. We've regenerated all of Act 1 in a rough pencil sketch style — black and white drawings that capture composition and action without getting lost in color and polish. It's a change that feels both humbling and right."

### Good
"I redid all the Act 1 storyboards. Made them worse on purpose. Let me explain."

---

### Bad
"One of the core technical challenges of this project is connecting language models to Blender in a way that's actually useful for animation production. This post documents our research, architecture decisions, and early proof-of-concept work."

### Good
"I need Blender to do what I say. That's the problem I'm solving."

---

### Bad
"We're making an animated movie, and we're doing it differently."

### Good
"I'm making a movie. It's called 'Fairy Dinosaur Date Night' and I'm using AI to help build it."

---

## Structure

**Lead with what happened**
Not with context. Context can come after.

**One idea per paragraph**
If you're covering multiple things, break them up.

**Use headers to break up long posts**
But make the headers useful. "What Changed" not "Section 2."

**End when you're done**
Don't add a conclusion paragraph that just restates everything.

---

## When You're Stuck

Read what you wrote out loud. If it sounds like a press release, rewrite it. If it sounds like you'd actually say it to someone, keep it.

Ask yourself: "Would I say this to a friend explaining what I did today?"

If the answer is no, rewrite it until the answer is yes.

---

## Technical Posts

Technical posts can be more detailed. But the same rules apply:
- Say what the thing does before explaining how
- Use code examples liberally
- Admit when you don't know something
- Don't oversell what the tool can do

---

## Honesty

This is the most important part.

If something doesn't work, say so. If you're not sure about something, say so. If you made a mistake, say so.

The whole point of this blog is to show what it's actually like to make a movie with AI. That includes the failures. Maybe especially the failures.

Don't spin. Don't sugarcoat. Just tell the truth about what happened.
