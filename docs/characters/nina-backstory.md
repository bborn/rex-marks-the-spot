## Childhood Background

Nina grew up as the middle child in a loud, loving Italian-Irish family in Boston. Three siblings, small house, constant chaos. She learned early to manage, mediate, and smooth things over. She was the peacekeeper, the one who could read a room, the one who made sure everyone felt heard.

Her mother worked two jobs after her father left. Nina, age 11, became the unofficial household manager. Dinner coordinator. Homework helper. Conflict resolver. She was parentified young, a role that felt natural because it was useful, because being needed felt like being loved.

She was the first in her family to go to college, financing it through scholarships and work-study. She met Gabe in business school - he was earnest and trying so hard. She saw past his awkwardness to his good heart. She thought she could help him relax, slow down, enjoy life.

She didn't realize he'd speed up instead.

## Fears

### Primary Fear: Invisibility
Nina's deepest fear is being unseen, unheard, taken for granted. She's spent her life making space for others, and somewhere along the way, she lost her own space. When Gabe checks his phone while she's talking, she feels herself disappearing.

### Secondary Fear: Repeating Her Mother's Life
Nina's mother sacrificed everything for her children and ended up exhausted and alone. Nina swore she'd have a partner, a true equal, someone who showed up. She's terrified she's ended up in the same place anyway.

### Hidden Fear: Her Own Anger
Nina has kept the peace so long she's scared of her own rage. When she finally lets it out - "Why can't you ever admit when you're wrong?!" - it's cathartic but also terrifying. What else is she holding?

## Motivations

### Surface Level: Keep the Family Functional
Nina manages schedules, emotions, logistics, relationships. She's the operating system the family runs on. Her immediate motivation is always: what does everyone need right now?

### Deeper Level: Be Seen by Gabe
Nina doesn't want more money or a bigger house. She wants Gabe to look at her the way he did in grad school - fully, completely, without a screen between them. She wants to be his priority, not his support staff.

### Unconscious Level: Find Herself Again
Before kids, before Gabe's career consumed everything, Nina had her own ambitions. She wanted to travel, write, maybe go back to school. Those dreams got shelved. The adventure in the Jurassic strips away all the logistics and reveals a woman who's capable, brave, and done waiting.

## Key Relationships

### With Gabe
Nina loves Gabe but she's exhausted by him. She's made excuses for his absences, translated his good intentions to disappointed kids, and maintained her patience long past its natural life.

Their relationship in the Jurassic becomes honest in a way domestic life didn't allow. Running from dinosaurs, they fight and connect and finally talk. "I hate those parties," she admits. "We're so busy lately we never get to spend time together, as a family."

When Gabe finally means his promise, Nina can tell. She's been reading his tells for fifteen years. This time is different.

### With Mia
Nina sees herself in Mia - the competence, the responsibility, the too-serious face. She worries she's passed on her own burdens. Mia shouldn't have to be "mature for her age." Mia should get to be eight.

Through the static-filled phone, Nina makes her own promise: "I promise... we're going to get back soon." It's mother to daughter, woman to woman, a vow across time.

### With Leo
Leo is Nina's uncomplicated joy. He's five, he's delightful, he needs her in simple ways - sippy cup by the bed, comfort when scared. She can still just be "Mommy" with Leo, without the weight of expectation.

### With Ruben
Nina doesn't interact much with Ruben directly, but she accepts his magic matter-of-factly. She's too practical to debate impossibility when impossibility is literally happening. A fairy godfather? Sure. Now how do we get home?

### With Jetplane
Nina calls Jetplane "this" and is skeptical of the creature at first. But she adapts - she always adapts. By the end, she's accepted that a prehistoric chicken-puppy is part of the family now.

## Character Arc

### Beginning State
Nina is the family manager, the enabler of Gabe's absence, the patient wife who's running out of patience. She puts on earrings while giving babysitter instructions, multi-tasking even her preparation for supposed relaxation. She's lost in logistics.

### Middle Crisis
The Jurassic strips Nina down. No schedule to manage. No emotional labor to perform for others. Just survival, just her and Gabe, just the raw truth of their relationship.

She finally says what she's been holding: "I didn't even want to go. I hate those parties." Then: "We're so busy lately we never get to spend time together." Then, sobbing: "What if we never see them again?"

### Turning Point
Nina's fierceness emerges not as anger but as action. She spots the cave. She grabs Gabe's suit collar and yanks him to safety. She's been taking care of people her whole life - now she does it at full power.

When she hears the kids' voices through the phone, she's not passive. "Kids!! Mia!? Can anyone hear me!?" She's reaching across time through sheer force of will.

### End State
Nina returns from the Jurassic having recovered something she'd lost - her own agency, her own fire, her own self. She's not just the household manager anymore. She's a partner whose voice matters, whose needs matter.

The breakfast scene shows a family in balance. Nina's not orchestrating everyone else's morning - she's part of it, present and claiming her space.

## Thematic Role

Nina represents the cost of being needed. She's given so much to managing her family that she's nearly lost herself. Her journey isn't about becoming stronger - she was always strong. It's about claiming space for her own needs, her own voice, her own anger.

"The Look" is her signature, and it's about communication beyond words. Nina has learned that direct confrontation gets dismissed, so she developed this devastating silent response. The adventure teaches her she can speak again - and that Gabe will finally listen.

Her arc complements Gabe's: he learns to be present, she learns to demand presence. Together, they become the partners they were supposed to be.
