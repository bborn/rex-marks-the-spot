## Prehistoric Background

Jetplane hatched approximately 67 million years ago in what would become Montana. His species - unnamed by paleontologists because they left no fossil record - was a small, feathered therapod, somewhere between compsognathus and modern poultry in form.

He was the runt of his clutch. Three siblings hatched before him, all larger, all faster, all more likely to survive. In the brutal mathematics of Cretaceous survival, Jetplane should have been predator food within his first week.

Instead, he developed two survival adaptations: exceptional tongue length (for catching insects from hiding) and the colorful digestive quirk that would eventually make him famous.

The rainbow farts were probably a defense mechanism. Startling colors, confusing scents - anything to distract predators while Jetplane fled. It worked often enough. He made it to young adulthood, a minor miracle for a runt in dinosaur times.

His territory was a swampy region near the time warp's eventual location. He'd seen strange phenomena before - his world had unstable pockets of spacetime that occasionally sparked blue and pulled things through. He learned to stay clear. Until the car arrived.

## Meeting the Bornszteins

Jetplane was investigating the crushed car when the kids came through the portal. To him, they were bizarre: small, no feathers, standing on two legs like predators but smelling like prey. Confusing.

But then Leo approached without aggression. Offered that first chocolate milk - spoiled, disgusting to mammals, absolutely delicious to a creature whose diet was normally insects and small lizards. Jetplane's brain, wired for survival, made a quick calculation: these strange creatures meant food.

The candy sealed the deal. Sour Patch Kids activated something in Jetplane's primitive brain that nothing in 67 million years had touched. Pleasure. Pure, uncomplicated pleasure. He'd follow these creatures anywhere if they kept the candy coming.

## Fears

### Primary Fear: Being Alone
Before Leo, Jetplane was solitary. His species wasn't pack-oriented, and his runt status made joining groups difficult anyway. He survived but he wasn't thriving. Loneliness wasn't a concept he could name, but he felt it.

Now he has a flock. The idea of losing Leo - losing the candy-provider, yes, but also the first creature who ever chose him - is terrifying.

### Secondary Fear: Big Predators
The T-Rex represents everything Jetplane evolved to flee. His species survived by being fast, hidden, and forgettable. Standing up to apex predators goes against every instinct. When he does it anyway (giant-sized, protecting Leo), it's the bravest thing he's ever done.

### Physical Fears
Loud noises (police sirens), bright lights, sudden movements. Standard prey-animal stuff, amplified by a lifetime of hypervigilance.

---

## Motivations

### Immediate: Stay Fed
Let's be honest: Jetplane's initial motivation is candy. The sour, sweet, colorful substance is like nothing in the Cretaceous. He'll do tricks, follow commands, risk his life - as long as the Sour Patch Kids keep coming.

### Developed: Protect Leo
Somewhere between the first candy and the canyon rescue, Jetplane's motivation shifted. Leo isn't just a food source anymore. Leo is *his*. The small human who named him, feeds him, pets him despite the smell. Jetplane would die for Leo. Not for abstract loyalty, but because Leo is the first creature who ever made him feel chosen.

### Unconscious: Belong
Jetplane's species is extinct. He has no community, no genetic future, no purpose in the grand scheme of evolution. The Bornsztein family offers something his prehistoric world never did: a place. He's not the runt anymore. He's Jetplane, family member, good boy.

---

## Key Relationships

### With Leo
This is the core relationship. Leo names him immediately, feeds him constantly, loves him unconditionally. To Jetplane's simple brain, Leo is safety, food, and joy compressed into one small human.

The tongue-save at the canyon isn't calculated heroism. It's pure instinct: Leo is falling, Leo needs help, Jetplane has a very long tongue. Action without thought, love without language.

### With Mia
Mia finds Jetplane "disgusting" and she's not wrong. He smells. He farts. His tongue is disturbingly long. But Mia also sees him save her brother, and the wall comes down.

By the end, Mia defends Jetplane's place in the family. She's not enthusiastic, but she's loyal. Jetplane respects her caution - she's the pack's lookout, always alert.

### With Ruben
Ruben sees Jetplane practically: a resource, a tool, useful for signal farts and eventually giant combat. But there's also recognition. Two underestimated creatures, dismissed by their respective worlds, suddenly crucial to survival.

When Ruben's magic makes Jetplane huge, something passes between them. Jetplane's first thought: "Wait, I can be BIG?" Ruben's first thought: "Wait, my magic can do THIS?" Mutual surprise at their own potential.

### With Gabe and Nina
The parents barely register Jetplane amid the survival chaos. He's filed under "strange but not immediately threatening." That changes when giant Jetplane saves them from the T-Rex. Gratitude, though they'd never admit a prehistoric chicken-thing could inspire such feeling.

## Character Arc

### Beginning State
Jetplane is a survivor, alone, making do. He's found a stable territory, developed his quirky defenses, and expects nothing more than continued solitary existence. The strange-smelling bipeds are curiosity, then food source.

### Middle Growth
Through the adventure, Jetplane experiences things his prehistoric life never offered: companionship, purpose, the rush of being needed. He's not just surviving anymore. He's mattering.

His farts become signal flares. His tongue becomes rescue equipment. His very existence - weird, impossible, perfect - becomes essential to saving the family.

### Climax
The giant Jetplane vs. T-Rex confrontation is everything. The runt, magically enormous, facing the nightmare that's haunted his species for millions of years. He doesn't fight - he intimidates. His weird gargle-roar, his preposterously long tongue, his sheer unexpected presence. The T-Rex retreats.

For one moment, Jetplane is the apex predator. And then he shrinks back down and curls up in Leo's backpack.

### End State
Jetplane makes it through the portal at the last second and successfully hides in the modern world. Shrunken to chihuahua size, concealed in a backpack, eventually revealed through colorful chimney plumes - he's home.

His arc is complete: from solitary runt to family member. Evolution didn't design him to survive extinction-level events, but love did.

## Vocalization Notes

Jetplane has no dialogue, but he has a full emotional vocabulary:

### Happy Sounds
- Purring gargle (content)
- Excited chirp-bark (joy)
- High-pitched trill (delight at candy)

### Scared Sounds
- Low whimper
- Rapid clicking
- High whistle (alarm)

### Protective Sounds
- Deep growl (warning)
- Hissing gargle (threat)
- Full roar (giant size only)

### Communication Sounds
- Questioning trill (what's happening?)
- Insistent chirp (pay attention to me)
- Soft coo (affection toward Leo)

---

## Animation Notes

### Physical Tells
- Ear-frills are emotional barometers
- Tail never stops moving (mood visible)
- Whole body bounces when excited
- Makes himself small when scared (prey instinct)

### Key Expression Moments
- First candy taste: eyes go huge, pure bliss
- Canyon rescue: instant shift from scared to action
- Giant form: same expressions, scaled up absurdly
- Chimney ending: satisfied pride (I made it)

### Signature Movements
- The fart crouch (preparation, release, pride)
- The head-tilt (curiosity, confusion)
- The full-body wag (joy)
- The tongue-extension (grossly long, incredibly useful)

### Scale Considerations
- Normal size: house-cat to small dog range
- Giant size: bigger than T-Rex
- Shrunken size: chihuahua
- All three should feel like the same creature

## Thematic Role

Jetplane represents joy without complication. In a film about workaholic parents, responsible children, and depressed fairies, he's pure id. He wants candy. He loves Leo. He farts rainbows.

But he's also about chosen family. Jetplane has no biological connection to these humans. He's from a different era, a different world, a different branch of life entirely. Yet he belongs with them more completely than he ever belonged anywhere.

His survival to the modern era is the film's final miracle. The family healed, the kids proved themselves, the parents transformed - and they also saved a dinosaur. They didn't just rescue each other; they rescued wonder itself.

The colorful chimney plumes in the final shot are Jetplane's signature, his flag, his announcement: "I'm here. I made it. And this family is mine now."

## Merchandise Notes

Jetplane is designed to sell plush toys. Every design decision should pass the "would kids hug this?" test:

- Big eyes (catchlights, always)
- Soft-looking texture (even if scaly)
- Expressive features (ear-frills, tail)
- Signature move (the fart pose is iconic)
- Scalable design (works at keychain size to giant plush)

The rainbow fart trails should photograph well, animate beautifully, and print on everything from t-shirts to lunchboxes. Jetplane is the breakout star waiting to happen.
