## Character Dynamics

### The Kids
Mia leads, Leo inspires. She's the strategy, he's the heart. Their sibling dynamic should feel natural - affection mixed with friction, protection mixed with independence.

### The Parents
Gabe is learning to be present; Nina is learning to demand presence. Their Jurassic arguments clear years of accumulated frustration, making room for renewed partnership.

### The Found Family
Ruben + Kids: Reluctant guardian becomes genuine hero
Leo + Jetplane: Immediate, unconditional, species-crossing bond
All six: By the end, a family unit that includes a prehistoric creature and a fairy

## Arc Alignment

All six characters share the same thematic question: What matters most?

| Character | Learns That... |
|-----------|----------------|
| Mia | She doesn't have to carry everything alone |
| Leo | His ideas matter; he can help |
| Gabe | Work success means nothing without family presence |
| Nina | Her voice and needs deserve space |
| Ruben | Caring is worth the risk of failure |
| Jetplane | He finally has a flock to belong to |
