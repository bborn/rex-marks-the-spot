## Childhood Background

Mia was born into a family already in motion. Gabe had just started his current job, and Nina was juggling part-time work with new motherhood. From her earliest memories, Mia learned that her parents were often tired, often busy, often distracted. She adapted by becoming self-sufficient early.

When Leo arrived three years later, something shifted in Mia. She found purpose. Here was someone who needed her, who looked up to her, who she could protect. She became the "little mom" of the family - helping Leo with breakfast, making sure he had his blanket, translating his toddler-speak to adults.

Mia excels at school, particularly reading and science. She's the kid who finishes early and then helps the other kids. Her teacher calls her "mature for her age," which Mia secretly doesn't like. She doesn't want to be mature. She wants to be a kid whose parents have time for her.

Her room is filled with books about adventure - fantasy novels, survival guides, animal encyclopedias. She devours stories about kids who save the day. In retrospect, she was preparing herself without knowing it.

## Fears

### Primary Fear: Abandonment
Mia's deepest fear is that her parents will leave and not come back. This isn't irrational anxiety - it's built from thousands of small disappointments. Gabe missing her school play. Nina rescheduling their "just us" lunch three times. The gradual erosion of presence into absence.

When her parents don't come home from the gala, her fear becomes reality. But here's the key to Mia's psychology: when her worst fear manifests, she doesn't collapse. She acts.

### Secondary Fear: Losing Leo
If something happened to Leo, Mia would never forgive herself. She's taken on responsibility for him that no 8-year-old should carry. When Leo falls from the crayon bridge, we see her terror - not for herself, but for failing to protect him.

### Hidden Fear: Not Being Enough
Beneath Mia's competence is a whisper of doubt. What if she's not smart enough to find them? What if her plans fail? What if being "mature for her age" isn't mature enough?

## Motivations

### Immediate: Save Her Parents
Mia takes action where adults hesitate. The social worker offers platitudes; Mia identifies the storm as the cause. Detective McNattin locks up the phone; Mia plans to steal it. Her motivation is simple and fierce: get her family back together.

### Deeper: Prove She Matters
Mia needs her parents to see her. Not the convenient, low-maintenance daughter who doesn't make a fuss. The real her - brave, capable, worthy of their full attention. Rescuing them is partly about proving she exists, that she's not invisible.

### Unconscious: Create the Family She Wants
The adventure forces the family to be present with each other. No phones, no meetings, no distractions. Just survival. On some level, Mia creates the conditions for the family she's always wanted - one that's fully together.

## Key Relationships

### With Leo
Mia is protective to a fault with Leo. She corrects his grammar, manages his behavior, speaks for him with adults. But she also genuinely loves him and respects his insights. Leo sees things she misses. His idea to use Jetplane's farts as a signal proves this - Mia would never have thought of it.

Their dynamic: she leads, he inspires. She's the strategy, he's the heart.

### With Gabe
Mia is hardest on her father. She feels his absence most acutely because she remembers when he was present. "Promise?" she asks him before they leave. She needs his word because his actions have failed her.

When Gabe tries to keep her from the portal, she defies him: "No. We're coming to get you." This isn't disrespect - it's the daughter becoming the parent's rescuer, a complete inversion that both scares and empowers her.

### With Nina
Mia's relationship with Nina is warmer but complicated. Nina tries to be present, but she's also the one who makes excuses for Gabe. Mia loves her mother deeply but has learned not to fully trust promises of change.

The static-filled phone connection to Nina is crucial. Even across 65 million years, Nina's voice reaches Mia. That connection sustains her.

### With Ruben
Mia is skeptical of Ruben initially. His magic doesn't work, he's clearly rusty, and he can't even unlock a door. But Mia also recognizes a kindred spirit - someone who's been overlooked and underestimated. She pushes him: "You have to try!"

Her faith in Ruben helps him rediscover his own abilities.

### With Jetplane
Mia finds Jetplane "disgusting" at first. She's more cautious than Leo, more practical. But Jetplane wins her over with loyalty. When his tongue saves Leo from the canyon, Mia's walls come down. By the end, she's defending his place in the family.

## Character Arc

### Beginning State
Mia is a parentified child - too responsible, too serious, carrying weight that isn't hers. Her competence is a defense mechanism. If she handles everything, she doesn't have to feel the hurt of being overlooked.

### Middle Crisis
The adventure forces Mia to rely on others. Ruben's magic. Leo's ideas. Jetplane's abilities. She can't do this alone. The bridge collapse - literally losing the structure she built - forces her to accept help.

### End State
Mia learns that needing others isn't weakness. Her parents nearly died, but they came back changed. They kept their promise. She can relax her vigilance and just be a kid.

The ending breakfast scene is key: Mia asks for whipped cream on her pancakes. A small request. A child's request. She's no longer the little adult running the family - she's an 8-year-old who wants something sweet.

## Voice Acting Notes

### Vocal Qualities
- Clear, slightly high-pitched but not babyish
- Deliberate speech pattern - she thinks before talking
- Gets faster when scared or excited
- Whispers conspiratorially with Leo
- Voice cracks when emotional (vulnerability breaking through)

### Key Emotional Beats
1. **"Promise?"** - hope mixed with doubt, almost challenging Gabe to mean it
2. **"We're coming to get you"** - pure determination, adult resolve in child's voice
3. **"Leo!"** when he falls - raw terror, the mask completely off
4. **Reunion joy - relief that's physical, laughing through tears

### What to Avoid
- Don't make her precocious or "wise beyond her years" in an annoying way
- She's not a miniature adult - she's a kid who's had to grow up fast
- Her bravery should feel costly, not effortless
- Even her frustrated moments should have love underneath

- Touches Leo's shoulder or back unconsciously (protective)
- Frowns when thinking, relaxes when solution appears
- Crosses arms when feeling defensive or unsure

- Fear that morphs into resolve (shows her working through it)
- Genuine surprise when Ruben's magic works
- Pure relief at family reunion

### Signature Gestures
- Hair flip when annoyed

## Thematic Role

Mia embodies the film's central question: What matters most? She's sacrificed her childhood for responsibility, and the adventure forces her parents to see what they've cost her. Her arc isn't about becoming braver (she already is) - it's about learning she doesn't have to carry everything alone.

Her final victory isn't defeating the T-Rex. It's asking for whipped cream and trusting someone will give it to her.
