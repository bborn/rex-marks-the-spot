## Childhood Background

Leo has never known a world without Mia looking out for him. His earliest memories are of his sister's face, explaining things, holding his hand, being the steady presence while their parents orbited around work and obligations.

This could have made Leo dependent or anxious. Instead, it made him free. With Mia handling the adult stuff, Leo has been allowed to simply *be* a kid. He lives in a world of wonder, where everything is interesting and nothing is too weird to explore.

His dinosaur obsession started at age 3 when Gabe took him to a natural history museum. Gabe was distracted, checking emails on his phone, but Leo was transformed. The fossils, the reconstructions, the impossible creatures that once walked the earth - he was hooked. His room became a Jurassic shrine: dinosaur pajamas, dinosaur toys, dinosaur sheets, dinosaur posters.

Leo's kindergarten teacher describes him as "delightfully chaotic." He's not disruptive on purpose - he just has so many questions. Why is the sky blue? Do dogs dream? What if we're all living in a dinosaur's dream? He exhausts adults but enchants other children.

He has a gap-tooth from falling off the jungle gym last month. He wasn't being careful (he's never careful), and he lost the tooth when he hit the ground. He was crying, then laughing, then showing everyone the bloody gap like a trophy.

## Fears

### Primary Fear: Being Left Behind
Leo's deepest fear is being forgotten, overlooked, not included. "I want to help!" is his constant refrain. He hates being treated as "too little" because he knows he has something to offer.

When the adults try to leave him somewhere safe, he resists. He'd rather be in danger with his family than safe and alone.

### Secondary Fear: Losing Mia
Mia is his constant. If Mia is scared, Leo is terrified. If Mia is confident, Leo feels invincible. The idea of being without her is almost incomprehensible to him.

### Physical Fears
Leo is scared of the dark, loud noises, and things with big teeth. Standard 5-year-old stuff. But here's the thing - these fears don't stop him. He's scared AND he does the thing anyway. That's his superpower.

## Motivations

### Immediate: Be Part of the Adventure
Leo wants IN. He wants to help drive the police car. He wants to feed Jetplane. He wants to run toward the dinosaur, not away. His motivation isn't abstract (save the family) - it's concrete (be where the action is).

### Deeper: Prove His Worth
Leo knows he's the youngest, the smallest, the one who needs help. But he also knows he's not useless. When he suggests using Jetplane's farts as a signal, he proves that fresh eyes see solutions adults miss.

### Unconscious: Keep the Family Together
Leo's attachment style is anxious-secure - he trusts his bonds but needs physical closeness to feel safe. The adventure, ironically, gives him more direct access to his parents than normal life does. He's terrified AND happy because everyone is finally together.

## Key Relationships

### With Mia
Leo adores Mia and depends on her, but he's not her shadow. He has his own ideas, his own courage, his own moments of brilliance. Mia leads; Leo surprises.

Their sibling banter is constant:
- "Leo! You can't drive a police car!"
- "I can!"

He mimics her expressions, follows her lead, but also pushes back when he knows something she doesn't. He found the phone under the pillow. His instincts matter.

### With Gabe
Leo's relationship with Gabe is less complicated than Mia's. He's younger; he doesn't remember when Gabe was more present. He accepts his father as a sometimes-distracted figure who occasionally shows up with cool museum trips.

The promise at the beginning means less to Leo - he doesn't have Mia's history of broken ones. But by the end, when Gabe says "Way to go!" with genuine presence, Leo feels seen in a new way.

### With Nina
Leo is a mama's boy at heart. Nina's voice through the static-filled phone sustains him. "There are dinosaurs here, but we're ok!" she says, and Leo believes her because he needs to believe her.

He needs his sippy cup by the bed. He still seeks physical comfort from Nina. The adventure forces him to be braver than his age, but he's still five years old and wants his mom.

### With Ruben
Leo is more accepting of Ruben than Mia is. He doesn't care that the magic doesn't work perfectly - he finds Ruben's mishaps hilarious. "Stropula bingulo zap!" he chants gleefully after watching the spell.

Leo's unconditional acceptance helps Ruben more than Mia's demanding expectations.

### With Jetplane
This is the heart of Leo's story. He finds a creature and immediately names it, feeds it, loves it. "His name is... his name is... JETPLANE!" No hesitation, no fear, pure connection.

Leo sees Jetplane as a "chicken-puppy," something to nurture. Jetplane sees Leo as a source of candy and affection. Together, they form a bond that crosses species and time.

When Leo feeds Jetplane sour candy and discovers the colorful farts, he's delighted, not disgusted. He sees possibilities where Mia sees problems.

## Character Arc

### Beginning State
Leo is protected, maybe overprotected. Mia handles things. Adults make decisions. Leo's role is to be adorable and manageable. He's content but not yet tested.

### Middle Crisis
The adventure demands Leo step up. Driving the car (sitting on Mia's lap, but still). Running toward the T-Rex as a distraction. Making the tactical decision about Jetplane's signal farts. He rises to each challenge with fear in his eyes and courage in his actions.

### End State
Leo returns home with a dinosaur (shrunk, hidden in his backpack) and a new confidence. He fed Jetplane. He helped save his parents. He belongs.

The ending scene - colored fart plumes coming from the chimney - is his signature moment. He successfully smuggled prehistoric life into the suburbs. He changed the world in his own small way.

## Thematic Role

Leo represents innocence that persists through danger. While the film asks "What matters most?" Leo's answer is simple: love, adventure, family, candy. He doesn't complicate things.

His relationship with Jetplane proves that connection doesn't require logic. A 5-year-old human and a prehistoric creature bond instantly because they both just want to play, eat snacks, and be loved.

Leo's final contribution - successfully smuggling Jetplane home - suggests that wonder doesn't have to end. The adventure continues. The magic is real. And sometimes a five-year-old knows exactly what to do.
