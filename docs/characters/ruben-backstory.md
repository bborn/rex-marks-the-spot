## Childhood Background (Fairy Edition)

Ruben was born in what mortals call the early 1970s, but fairy calendars measure differently. He grew up in the Fairy Realm's lower-middle-class borough of Glimsdale - not the gleaming spires of Crystalhaven where the famous godparents lived, but a respectable neighborhood of modest wands and steady work.

His parents were both licensed C-class fairies. Father handled rodent transformations (mice to horses, that sort of thing). Mother specialized in pumpkin work - carriages, mostly, for the regional territory around Bavaria. Good, honest fairy labor.

Young Ruben had talent. His teachers noticed early that his magical aptitude exceeded his class. He could have tested into B-class, maybe even A-class programs. But Ruben was comfortable in Glimsdale, comfortable with expectations he could meet, comfortable not risking failure.

He became a C-class fairy godfather, just like his parents. Weddings, minor wishes, household magic. Nothing world-changing. Nothing heartbreaking when it went wrong.

## The Glory Days

For three decades, Ruben was good at his job. Not spectacular, not famous, but reliable. Families liked him. Kids warmed to his gruff humor. He handled the assigned cases, filed the paperwork, collected his modest fairy salary.

Then came the Morrison case.

The Morrison family - single mother, two kids, job loss, mounting crisis. Ruben was assigned. He poured everything into it. Creative solutions. Extra magic. Bending rules. He got invested in a way his training warned against.

It almost worked. Jobs came through, relationships healed, hope returned. But then - and Ruben still doesn't fully understand how - it all collapsed. The magic backfired. The family ended up worse than before. The mother blamed Ruben. The fairy council investigated.

Ruben wasn't found guilty of malfeasance, but he wasn't cleared either. The verdict: "Excessive emotional involvement leading to judgment impairment." His license was downgraded to probationary status. One more incident and he'd lose his wings.

That was eleven years ago. Ruben has spent every year since then avoiding investment, avoiding risk, avoiding care.

## Fears

### Primary Fear: Caring Again
Ruben is terrified of the Morrison case repeating. He's learned that caring leads to trying hard, trying hard leads to mistakes, and mistakes lead to devastating failure. Better to coast. Better to not engage. Better to be the janitor with an empty mop bucket than the hero who lets everyone down.

### Secondary Fear: Losing His Wings
The probation is real. One more screw-up and Ruben loses his magic permanently. He'd become a mortal, or worse, a wingless fairy - pitied, diminished, nothing. The fear keeps him safe. It also keeps him small.

### Hidden Fear: He Was Never Good Enough
Deep down, Ruben suspects the Morrison case didn't fail because he cared too much. It failed because he wasn't talented enough. His C-class designation wasn't humility - it was accuracy. He's haunted by the possibility that he simply doesn't have what it takes.

## Motivations

### Surface Level: Don't Get Fired
Ruben's immediate motivation is survival. Do the minimum. Stay under the radar. Collect the paycheck. Don't engage emotionally. His janitor disguise at the police station isn't cover - it's his whole approach to existence.

### Deeper Level: Redemption
Ruben took this assignment (the Bornsztein kids) because headquarters said it was his last chance. He doesn't admit it, but part of him wants to prove he can still do it. The Morrison case haunts him partly because he never got to try again.

### Unconscious Level: Connection
Ruben is lonely. Eleven years of emotional distance have isolated him completely. He has no friends, no family (fairy or otherwise), no one who needs him. Mia and Leo offer something he didn't know he was missing: the chance to matter again.

---

## Key Relationships

### With Mia
Mia pushes Ruben in ways that make him uncomfortable. "You have to try!" she demands when his magic fails. She doesn't accept his cynicism, doesn't let him coast, doesn't give up on him even when he's given up on himself.

At first, Ruben finds her exhausting. By the end, he finds her inspiring. She believes in him before he believes in himself.

### With Leo
Leo accepts Ruben completely and immediately. No judgment about failed magic. No expectation of competence. Just gleeful "Stropula bingulo zap!" mimicry and genuine delight at whatever Ruben does.

Leo's unconditional warmth melts something frozen in Ruben. You can't maintain world-weary cynicism when a five-year-old is literally bouncing with excitement at your misfired spell.

### With Gabe and Nina
Ruben barely interacts with the parents directly, but he recognizes their dynamic. Gabe's distraction, Nina's patience wearing thin - Ruben has seen this before in a thousand families. He knows what they need to learn, but he's not here to fix their marriage. He's here for the kids.

When he finally meets them at the canyon, Ruben's introduction is peak character: "Ruben Romanovsky. C-class, licensed and bonded professional fairy Godfather. Great to meet you." Even in crisis, the formality of eleven years of emotional distance.

### With Jetplane
Ruben's relationship with Jetplane is professional respect. "Makes sense to me," he says about the colorful farts. He approaches the creature practically - it can be useful. But there's also appreciation. Jetplane is weird and impossible and exactly what this situation needs.

When Ruben's magic makes Jetplane huge, it's the biggest success of his career. "I did it?" he says, surprised. "I did. Didn't I?"

## Character Arc

### Beginning State
Ruben is dead inside and working hard to stay that way. The janitor disguise is perfect because it's invisible. He pushes the mop, he stays quiet, he doesn't get involved. His wings droop. His magic sputters. He's sleepwalking through existence.

### Middle Crisis
The kids need him. Actually need him. Not in an abstract fairy-assignment way but in a life-or-death, your-parents-are-in-the-Jurassic-era way. Ruben can't coast through this. He has to engage.

Every magical failure is a reminder of his inadequacy. But every small success is a shock. The lock spell works (eventually). The freeze spell saves them from McNattin. Maybe he's not as broken as he thought.

### Turning Point
At the canyon, Ruben has a choice. He's "not supposed to" use transport magic. It'll "probably lose my wings." But the kids are in danger, and the phone is dying, and for the first time in eleven years, Ruben chooses to care more about someone else than about protecting himself.

"A fairy godfather's gotta do what a fairy godfather's gotta do."

He risks everything. And the magic works - not perfectly, but enough. They escape.

### End State
Ruben's wings are probably on probation forever now. He definitely broke some rules. But he also saved a family, found a purpose, and remembered what he was meant to be.

His cynicism isn't gone - he'll always be sardonic. But it's protective coloration now, not a cage. Underneath, there's a fairy godfather who finally lives up to the title.

- Eastern European accent (Polish/Russian adjacent)
- Low energy baseline, like he's permanently exhausted
- Brightens unconsciously around the kids
- Magic words enunciated clearly (suddenly present)
- Muttering is constant background texture

### Key Emotional Beats
1. **"I'm your fairy godfather"** - delivered reluctantly, like admitting embarrassing truth
2. **"I can't! Remember!?"** - frustration at his own limitations
3. **"It worked?"** - genuine shock, vulnerability showing
4. **"A fairy godfather's gotta do what a fairy godfather's gotta do"** - quiet resolution, heroism

### What to Avoid
- Don't play depression as comedy - it's real and should have weight
- Cynicism should feel like armor, not personality
- Magical failures should land with genuine disappointment
- Success should feel earned, not easy

## Thematic Role

Ruben is the adult mirror to the kids' journey. Where Mia and Leo are learning to rely on others, Ruben is learning to let himself be relied upon. Where Gabe learns to be present, Ruben learns to be engaged.

He also represents a specific kind of adult failure: not villainy, not cruelty, but giving up. The Morrison case broke him not because he did something wrong but because he cared and still failed. His arc asks: Is it better to never try, or to try and risk failure?

The answer, of course, is to try. Ruben's final magical transport saves the family because he stops protecting himself and starts protecting them. His redemption isn't about succeeding - it's about caring again.

"I'm not really in top form," he warns. But he's wrong. His top form was always heart, not technique. When he finds it again, the magic follows.
