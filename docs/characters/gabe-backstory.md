## Childhood Background

Gabriel Bornsztein grew up in a middle-class family in Minneapolis. His father was a high school math teacher, his mother a librarian. They were present but not affluent - money was always a quiet worry in the household.

Gabe was a good student, not brilliant. He worked harder than his peers to get the same grades. This taught him that success comes from effort, from never stopping, from always working just a little bit more. He got into a decent college on a partial scholarship and worked two jobs to cover the rest.

He met Nina during his MBA program. She was in marketing; he was in finance. She laughed at his dad jokes. He couldn't believe someone so beautiful and together wanted to be with him. They married young, before careers fully launched, betting on a future they'd build together.

When Mia was born, Gabe was still establishing himself. He worked late, missed dinners, promised himself he'd be more present "once things settled down." Things never settled down. Leo arrived, and Gabe was making partner, and the kids grew while he was looking at spreadsheets.

Now he's a senior director at a financial services firm. Good salary, decent title, entirely exchangeable with a hundred other stressed professionals. He's won the race he set out to run and realized he might have run the wrong race.

## Fears

### Primary Fear: Inadequacy
Gabe's deepest fear is that he's not enough - not successful enough, not present enough, not the husband and father his family deserves. He works so hard because he's terrified of falling short.

The horrible irony: his efforts to be "enough" financially make him utterly inadequate emotionally.

### Secondary Fear: Becoming His Father
Gabe's dad was a good man but tired. Always tired. Gabe remembers wanting more from him - more energy, more adventure, more presence. He promised himself he'd be different. He's not different.

### Hidden Fear: Being Seen
If Gabe stops moving, stops achieving, stops *doing*, who is he? He's scared to find out. The constant work isn't just ambition - it's avoidance.

## Motivations

### Surface Level: Professional Success
Gabe tells himself he works for his family. Nice house, good schools, secure future. But there's no retirement number that would make him stop. The work has become the identity.

### Deeper Level: Proving Himself
To whom? Maybe his father. Maybe his younger self who struggled. Maybe Nina, who he still can't believe chose him. Gabe is still that scholarship kid working two jobs, convinced he'll lose everything if he stops.

### Unconscious: Connection
What Gabe actually wants is what he's running from. He wants to sit on the couch with his kids and watch cartoons without checking his phone. He wants to look at Nina without calculating how late he is. He wants to be present. But presence is terrifying because it means facing what he's missed.

## Key Relationships

### With Nina
Gabe loves Nina completely but shows it poorly. He takes her patience for granted, assumes her support is infinite, and misses the strain building behind her patient smile.

Their dynamic in the Jurassic scenes reveals their fundamental pattern: Nina pushes for truth; Gabe deflects. "Why can't you ever admit when you're wrong?!" she screams while running from a T-Rex. Even in mortal peril, their relationship problems surface.

But there's still love there. When they hold each other in the tree, when Gabe finally says "Promise" and means it, the foundation reveals itself solid beneath the cracks.

### With Mia
Gabe is hardest on Mia because he sees himself in her - the drive, the seriousness, the weight of responsibility. He doesn't know how to be soft with her because he doesn't know how to be soft with himself.

"Promise?" she asks, and he hesitates. He's broken so many promises to her. But this time, stranded in prehistoric wilderness, he keeps it. That matters.

### With Leo
Gabe is gentler with Leo because Leo is still unambiguously a child. There's no reflection of Gabe's flaws, just a dinosaur-obsessed 5-year-old who wants chocolate milk. Gabe can simply be "Dad" with Leo in ways he struggles to be with Mia.

When Leo runs toward the T-Rex as a distraction, Gabe runs too. Not thinking, just acting on father-instinct. "Hey! Over here! You want him? You're gonna have to come through me first!" It's the most present moment of his life.

### With Ruben
Gabe barely registers Ruben at first - just another complication. But Ruben's failure-to-success arc mirrors what Gabe needs to learn: it's okay to be rusty, to mess up, to need help. The cynical fairy godfather and the distracted father are both men who've lost touch with what they once could be.

## Character Arc

### Beginning State
Gabe is physically present but emotionally absent. He's checking his phone at the gala prep, negotiating bedtime as negotiation rather than connection, already calculating how late they can come home. He's the worst version of the man Nina married.

### Middle Crisis
The Jurassic throws Gabe into primal survival mode. No phones, no meetings, no spreadsheets - just staying alive with his wife. Stripped of all distractions, he has to face Nina's accumulated frustration AND his own failure to be present.

"We should've stopped them. We should've protected them," he says about the kids coming through the portal. He's talking about the adventure, but he's also talking about everything.

### Turning Point
When Gabe runs toward the T-Rex to protect Leo, he's not calculating risk. He's not checking outcomes. He's purely, completely a father. It might be stupid, but it's love made visible.

### End State
The breakfast scene shows a changed man. Gabe's not doing a board meeting; he's taking Mia to the lizard shop. He promised. The promise means something now because he's learned what broken promises cost.

He's not magically perfect. He'll slip. He'll check his phone. But there's been a reset, a recalibration of priorities. The family he almost lost is now the center.

## Voice Acting Notes

### Vocal Qualities
- Starts clipped, businesslike, slightly rushed
- Gets slower, warmer as adventure progresses
- Stress visible in voice (tight, controlled)
- Relief comes out in exhales, broken words
- Dad jokes are delivered with anticipatory delight

### Key Emotional Beats
1. **"Promise."** (opening) - forced, reluctant, already halfway out the door
2. **"We need to... run!"** - panic, primal fear, voice cracking
3. **"Hey! Over here!"** - heroic dad roar, full commitment
4. **"Promise."** (ending) - quiet, full, present

### What to Avoid
- Don't make him villainous - he's failing, not malicious
- His work obsession should feel like addiction, not choice
- Moments of genuine warmth should surprise (him and us)
- Frustration should be self-directed, not aimed at family

## Animation Notes

### Physical Tells
- Constantly checking watch/phone in opening
- Body angled away from conversation (one foot toward door)
- Glasses pushed up when nervous
- Loosening tie as chaos increases

### Key Expression Moments
- Distraction (eyes elsewhere) transforming to presence (full eye contact)
- Terror when facing dinosaur (glasses magnify fear)
- Determination when running to protect Leo
- Softness holding Nina in the tree

### Signature Gestures
- Watch-checking (disappears through adventure)
- Pushing glasses up nervously
- Hand on back of neck when embarrassed
- Finally: arms open for family hug

### Costume Arc
- Starts: perfect tuxedo, controlled appearance
- Middle: increasingly destroyed, mud-stained, torn
- End: casual, relaxed, dressed for pancakes not presentation

## Thematic Role

Gabe is the film's cautionary tale AND redemption arc. He represents every parent who's let work eclipse family, every adult who's forgotten what they're working for. His transformation isn't about becoming a different person - it's about becoming the father he always intended to be.

The near-death experience is literal but also metaphorical. Gabe's old self - the distracted, absent workaholic - dies in the Jurassic. What comes back through the portal is a man who learned, the hard way, what matters most.

His final pancake-flipping scene isn't heroic. It's domestic. It's ordinary. And that's the point. Heroism isn't fighting dinosaurs. Heroism is showing up for breakfast.
