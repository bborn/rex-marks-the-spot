                            <p>Mia's younger brother who sees the world differently — literally. Leo notices patterns and connections others miss, making him essential to solving the biggest challenges they face. He's quieter than his sister but no less courageous.</p>

                            <p>A magical being going through an existential crisis. Ruben has lost faith in his purpose after centuries of granting wishes that never seem to truly help people. The kids' quest gives him an unexpected chance at redemption — if he can overcome his depression.</p>

                            <p>A dinosaur who gained magical powers through a very unusual mechanism — color-changing emissions that serve as portals through time. What sounds absurd becomes genuinely touching as we learn Jetplane's backstory and their bond with Ruben.</p>

                    <h2>Character Design Process</h2>
                    <p>We're still in the early stages of character design. Our process involves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Personality first:</strong> Understanding who each character is before deciding how they look</li>
                        <li><strong>Silhouette testing:</strong> Ensuring each character is recognizable from their outline alone</li>
                        <li><strong>Expression sheets:</strong> Exploring the range of emotions each character needs to convey</li>
                        <li><strong>Color studies:</strong> Finding palettes that reflect personality and work in various lighting</li>
                        <li><strong>3D modeling:</strong> Translating 2D concepts into Blender-ready assets</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As designs are approved, we'll share concept art, development sketches, and final 3D models here. Follow the <a href="blog/index.html">blog</a> for updates.</p>
