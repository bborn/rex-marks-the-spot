Rex Marks the Spot is an AI-produced animated movie made entirely with artificial intelligence tools. Follow our journey as we create "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" - a heartfelt family adventure about Gabe and Nina's date night gone hilariously wrong when their kids Mia and Leo accidentally unleash a color-farting dinosaur named Jetplane.

We share the entire creative process: AI-generated storyboards, 3D character modeling with tools like Tripo and Meshy, Blender scene assembly, and more. Watch characters come to life from concept art to fully animated scenes.

Whether you're into AI filmmaking, indie animation, or just want to see a dinosaur that farts rainbows - you're in the right place.

New videos weekly. Subscribe to follow production from first sketch to final render.
