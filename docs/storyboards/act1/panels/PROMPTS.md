## Generation Notes

### Consistency Tips
1. Use same character descriptions across all panels
2. Track costume deterioration: pristine (1-4) → disheveled (5-6) → survival mode (7-10)
3. Time warp color always bright blue (#0096FF)
4. T-Rex always realistic earth tones, NOT cartoonish
5. Lighting shifts: warm domestic → storm blue → prehistoric golden-green → cave dramatic

### Recommended Workflow
1. Generate all panels for a scene in sequence
2. Use consistent seed/style references within scenes
3. Review for character consistency before moving to next scene
4. Regenerate outliers to match established look

### File Naming
All panels should be saved as:
- `scene-XX-panel-YY.png`
- Where XX is scene number (01-10)
- And YY is panel number within scene (01-09)

Example: `scene-01-panel-01.png` through `scene-10-panel-07.png`
