## Act 1 Narrative Summary

### Part A: The Departure (Scenes 1-6)
The Bornsztein family's ordinary evening turns extraordinary when parents Gabe and Nina leave for a gala, promising their kids Mia and Leo they'll return. Driving through a storm, their car crashes into a TIME WARP and disappears. At home, the TV explodes and Nina's phone mysteriously glows.

### Part B: The Jurassic (Scenes 7-10)
Nina and Gabe wake in prehistoric times. Wonder at the lush Jurassic world turns to terror when a T-REX appears and destroys their car. Fleeing through dense jungle, chased by multiple dinosaurs, they find refuge in a cave. As dinosaurs battle outside, they realize with dawning horror: they've left their children behind. The phone in Nina's hand becomes their only hope.
