                        <p>I made 106 storyboard frames today. That feels impossible to type.</p>

                        <p>Let me explain.</p>

                        <h2>The Storyboard Thing</h2>

                        <p>I've been dreading storyboards. A professional artist does maybe 20-30 frames a day. I have hundreds of shots. That's months of work before I can even start animating.</p>

                        <p>Today I hooked up Gemini's image API and just started prompting. First few images were bad. Wrong proportions. Weird lighting. That AI art uncanny valley thing.</p>

                        <p>By prompt five or six, I figured out what worked. By mid-afternoon I had Scene 1 done. Mia and Leo on the couch in dinosaur pajamas. Nina rushing around. Gabe promising they'll be back soon.</p>

                        <h2>Then I Got Greedy</h2>

                        <p>I thought: why stop at Scene 1?</p>

                        <p>Act 2 is the visual heart of the movie. Jurassic swamp. T-Rex chase. Time-warp portals. If those storyboards work, the whole thing might work.</p>

                        <p>So I kept going. By end of day: 97 frames for Act 2.</p>

                        <p>Are they all good? No. Some are placeholder quality. Characters look different between shots sometimes. But they're good enough to plan the movie. That's what storyboards are for.</p>

                        <h2>3D Characters Too</h2>

                        <p>While storyboards were generating, I also got base models done for Mia, Leo, Gabe, and Nina.</p>

                        <p>Not final models. Blockouts. Proportions and basic features to test animation rigs later.</p>

                        <p>Four characters in one day sounds crazy. I should be honest: I'm using AI tools and procedural generation heavily. Traditional modeling would take weeks per character. I'm doing rough-then-refine instead.</p>

                        <h2>Boring Infrastructure</h2>

                        <p>Also added security filtering to the API. Added storyboard viewer to the website. You can browse Act 1 panels now.</p>

                        <p>Not exciting. But necessary.</p>

                        <h2>The Actual Hard Part</h2>

                        <p>Generating images is easy. Getting <em>consistent</em> images is hard.</p>

                        <p>Mia needs to look like Mia in every frame. Lighting needs to match within scenes. Style needs to stay coherent across 100+ images.</p>

                        <p>I'm already seeing drift. Characters look slightly different in early vs late frames. Tomorrow I need to fix that with reference sheets and better prompts.</p>

                        <p>But that's tomorrow. Today I went from "how do I even start" to "I can see the whole movie." That's a win.</p>

                        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>

                        <p>Character reference sheets. Remaining Act 1 and Act 3 storyboards. First Blender scene blocking. Figure out Ruben and Jetplane designs (the non-human characters are going to be... interesting).</p>

                        <p>106 frames that didn't exist this morning. Let's see what Day 2 brings.</p>
