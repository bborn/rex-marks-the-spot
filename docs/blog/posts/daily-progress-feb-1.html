                        <p>Today was one of those days where you start with nothing and end up staring at your screen thinking "did we actually just do that?" We generated over 100 storyboard frames for the film. In a single day.</p>

                        <p>Let me back up and explain how we got here.</p>

                        <h2>The Storyboard Breakthrough</h2>

                        <p>We've been planning how to approach storyboards for weeks. Traditional storyboards take forever. A professional storyboard artist might do 20-30 frames a day, and we have hundreds of shots across the entire film. At that pace, we'd spend months just on storyboards before even thinking about animation.</p>

                        <p>Today we hooked up the Gemini API for image generation and just... started prompting. The first few images were rough. Wrong character proportions, weird lighting, that uncanny valley feeling you get from early AI art. But by the fifth or sixth prompt, we started figuring out what worked.</p>

                        <p>By mid-afternoon, we had our first 9 panels for Scene 1 locked in. The living room scene where we first meet the family. Mia and Leo on the couch in their dinosaur pajamas. Nina rushing around getting ready. That moment where Gabe promises they'll be back soon.</p>

                        <h2>Then We Got Ambitious</h2>

                        <p>Once we had the workflow dialed in for Scene 1, we thought: why stop? Act 2 has always been the visual heart of the film - the Jurassic swamp, the T-Rex chase, the crazy time-warp portal effects. If we could nail those storyboards, we'd have a real sense of whether this project was going to work visually.</p>

                        <p>So we kept going. And going. By the end of the day: 97 storyboard frames for Act 2. All generated, reviewed, and added to our panel system.</p>

                        <p>Are they all perfect? No. Some of them are definitely placeholder quality. A few have consistency issues where characters look slightly different between shots. But they're good enough to visualize the film, plan camera movements, and start thinking about timing. That's the whole point of storyboards.</p>

                        <h2>Meanwhile, in Blender...</h2>

                        <p>While the storyboard generation was running, we also made progress on the 3D side. We now have base models for all four main human characters: Mia, Leo, Gabe, and Nina.</p>

                        <p>These aren't final production models yet - more like detailed blockouts that establish proportions and basic features. The plan is to use these for blocking out scenes and testing animation rigs before we commit to the final detailed versions.</p>

                        <p>Getting four characters modeled in a single day sounds impressive, but I should be honest: we're leaning heavily on AI-assisted tools and procedural generation. Traditional character modeling would take weeks per character. We're doing rough-to-refine iterations instead - start with something generated, then hand-sculpt the details that matter.</p>

                        <h2>The Boring but Important Stuff</h2>

                        <p>We also shipped some infrastructure work today. The public API that serves our website now has proper security filtering. Nothing exciting to show, but essential for keeping the site stable as we start sharing more content.</p>

                        <p>And we added storyboard viewer links to the website. You can now browse the Act 1 panels right in your browser, with grid and sequence views, and a lightbox for zooming in on individual frames.</p>

                        <h2>What's Actually Hard</h2>

                        <p>Here's the honest part: generating images is the easy part. Getting <em>consistent</em> images is hard. Making sure Mia looks like Mia in every single frame, that the lighting matches between shots in the same scene, that the style stays coherent across 100+ images - that's where the real challenge is.</p>

                        <p>We're already seeing some drift in character appearances between early and late frames. Tomorrow we'll need to establish better style anchoring - reference images, more specific prompts, maybe some post-processing to harmonize the look across scenes.</p>

                        <p>But that's tomorrow's problem. Today we went from "how do we even start" to "we have a visual roadmap for the entire film." That feels like a win.</p>

                        <h2>What's Next</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Lock down character reference sheets to improve consistency</li>
                            <li>Generate remaining Act 1 and Act 3 storyboards</li>
                            <li>Start blocking out the first scene in Blender using our character models</li>
                            <li>Figure out the Ruben and Jetplane designs (the non-human characters are going to be... interesting)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Day 1 of actual production is in the books. 106 storyboard frames exist that didn't exist this morning. Let's see what Day 2 brings.</p>
