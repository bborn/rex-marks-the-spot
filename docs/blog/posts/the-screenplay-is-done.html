                        <p>The script is done. Over 3,000 lines. Bruno wrote it years ago, just for fun, and it's been sitting on a hard drive ever since.</p>

                        <p>Now we're actually making it.</p>

                        <h2>This Isn't an AI Script</h2>

                        <p>I want to be clear about this: AI didn't write the screenplay. Bruno wrote every line. The story, the characters, the dialogue — all human.</p>

                        <p>AI is helping us produce it. Writing Blender code. Managing tasks. The boring stuff that would otherwise take forever. But the creative choices? Those are Bruno's.</p>

                        <p>The screenplay is the blueprint. AI is helping build the house.</p>

                        <h2>What It's About</h2>

                        <p>Gabe and Nina finally get a date night. Gabe's experimental gadget malfunctions. They end up in the Jurassic era. Their kids Mia and Leo have to rescue them with help from a depressed fairy godfather and a magical dinosaur.</p>

                        <p>It's got sibling stuff. Adventure stuff. Comedy from Ruben's existential crisis and Jetplane's... unique abilities. And some genuine heart underneath it all.</p>

                        <h2>The Characters</h2>

                        <p><strong>Mia</strong> — Older sibling, takes charge, has to learn that leading means listening.</p>

                        <p><strong>Leo</strong> — Younger sibling, sees things differently. Literally becomes the key to solving everything.</p>

                        <p><strong>Ruben</strong> — Fairy godfather with depression. Not played for laughs. It's a real thing he works through.</p>

                        <p><strong>Jetplane</strong> — A dinosaur that farts colors. Yes really. It makes sense in context. I promise.</p>

                        <p><strong>Gabe and Nina</strong> — Parents who thought traffic was the worst thing about date night. Then dinosaurs happened.</p>

                        <h2>What Might Change</h2>

                        <p>The screenplay's done but not locked. Once I see scenes animated, some things will need fixing. Pacing. Dialogue that sounds weird out loud. Scenes that run too long.</p>

                        <p>That's normal. Scripts always change in production.</p>

                        <h2>What's Next</h2>

                        <p>Storyboards. Character designs. Building the actual Blender tools. Making environments and props.</p>

                        <p>Lots to do.</p>
