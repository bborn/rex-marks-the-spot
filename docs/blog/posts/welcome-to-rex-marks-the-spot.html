                        <p>Hey. I'm making a movie. It's called "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" and I'm using AI to help build it.</p>

                        <p>This blog is where I'll show you how it's going. The good stuff, the stuff that breaks, the things I have no idea how to solve yet.</p>

                        <h2>Why?</h2>

                        <p>Everyone has opinions about AI and art. I got tired of arguing about it. So I'm just going to make something and see what happens.</p>

                        <p>Not a tech demo. An actual movie. With characters and a story and hopefully some moments that make you feel something.</p>

                        <h2>What's Here</h2>

                        <p>Production updates. How things actually work (or don't). Technical stuff about Blender and AI tools. When I mess up, I'll tell you. When something works better than expected, I'll tell you that too.</p>

                        <h2>The Movie</h2>

                        <p>Two kids. Their parents accidentally get zapped to the Jurassic era during date night. The kids have to rescue them with help from a depressed fairy godfather and a dinosaur that farts colors.</p>

                        <p>I know. But trust me, it works.</p>

                        <h2>About the AI Thing</h2>

                        <p>I'm not replacing artists. I'm one person trying to make a movie that would normally require a studio. AI is how I'm attempting that.</p>

                        <p>I'll be honest about what it can and can't do. No hype. Just what actually happens when you try to make things this way.</p>

                        <h2>What's Coming</h2>

                        <p>The screenplay's done. Now I'm figuring out how to get Blender to do what I want through code. It's going... interestingly.</p>

                        <p>I'll be posting about connecting language models to Blender, character designs as they come together, and probably a lot of things that don't work the first time.</p>

                        <h2>That's It</h2>

                        <p>I don't know if this will work. I think it might. Either way, it'll be interesting to document.</p>

                        <p>Let's find out.</p>
