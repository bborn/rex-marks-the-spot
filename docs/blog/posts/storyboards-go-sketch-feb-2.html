                        <p>I redid all the Act 1 storyboards. Made them worse on purpose.</p>

                        <p>Let me explain.</p>

                        <h2>Pretty Pictures Were the Problem</h2>

                        <p>My first storyboards looked good. Full color. Detailed renders. Impressive.</p>

                        <p>But that was the problem. Look at Pixar's storyboards sometime. They're messy. Rough pencil sketches. Sometimes barely legible.</p>

                        <p>Why? Because storyboards aren't supposed to look good. They're supposed to show if the scene works. Pretty pictures hide bad storytelling. You look at a beautiful frame and don't notice the shot doesn't make sense.</p>

                        <p>Also: the nicer something looks, the harder it is to throw away. Rough sketches are easy to kill.</p>

                        <h2>What I Changed</h2>

                        <p>Regenerated all Act 1 panels as rough pencil sketches. Black and white. Loose lines. They look like what they are: planning documents.</p>

                        <p>Also added character model previews to the storyboard viewer. Now I can see how the 3D characters relate to the 2D planning.</p>

                        <h2>Jetplane Exists Now</h2>

                        <p>Got preview renders of Jetplane, the color-farting dinosaur. Rotund. Friendly. Big amber eyes. Seeing him in 3D helps me figure out how he'll actually move around.</p>

                        <h2>AI 3D Generation Research</h2>

                        <p>Tested Meshy.ai, Tripo3D, Hyper3D Rodin. Text-to-3D and image-to-3D tools.</p>

                        <p>Verdict: useful for background props and environmental stuff. Not ready for main characters that need to look consistent across hundreds of shots.</p>

                        <p>Main cast stays hand-crafted. Background vegetation and minor creatures? AI might save time there.</p>

                        <h2>Next</h2>

                        <p>Regenerating Act 2 and Act 3 in sketch style too. Then all three acts match.</p>

                        <p>Funny thing: I'm using AI to make intentionally rough-looking images. But that's the point. The tool serves the process. Sometimes the best thing AI can do is get out of the way of the story.</p>

                        <h2>Honestly</h2>

                        <p>This feels better. The polished storyboards felt like they had to prove something. Had to justify using AI by looking impressive.</p>

                        <p>The sketches don't carry that weight. They're just planning documents.</p>

                        <p>That's what I need right now.</p>
