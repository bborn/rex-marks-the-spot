                        <p>I built an automated QA system for the storyboards. It immediately told me one of my panels was garbage.</p>

                        <p>Fair enough.</p>

                        <h2>The TV Static Incident</h2>

                        <p>Panel 01-06. It was supposed to show the TV glitching as the portal opens. Instead, it looked like... actual static. The kind you'd see if your cable was out.</p>

                        <p>The QA bot scored it a 2 out of 5. Its note: "Purpose unclear. Suggest redrawing or clarifying purpose."</p>

                        <p>It was right. A storyboard panel should tell you something. This one just looked like a broken television. If someone else saw it, they wouldn't know if it was story-essential or a rendering error.</p>

                        <p>So I regenerated it. New panel shows the TV with visible energy interference, the babysitter's concerned face reflected in the screen. Now it communicates: something weird is happening, and people are noticing.</p>

                        <p>The whole loop took maybe an hour. Bot flags problem, I review, I agree, I fix. That's the system working.</p>

                        <h2>Voice Revisions Merged</h2>

                        <p>The character voices got another pass. ElevenLabs is surprisingly good at giving each character a distinct feel. Gabe sounds like a tired dad trying to stay upbeat. Nina has that focused-but-fraying quality of someone managing too many things at once.</p>

                        <p>The kids were harder. AI voices often make children sound either too cute or uncannily adult. Took some prompt tuning to find the right balance. Mia needed to sound like she's trying to be grown-up. Leo needed that younger-sibling chaos energy.</p>

                        <p>Revisions are merged. Not final, but good enough to start roughing out scene timing.</p>

                        <h2>Act 2 Storyboards: Round Two</h2>

                        <p>Regenerated the Act 2 storyboards in the new sketch style. 97 panels, all rough pencil now instead of polished renders.</p>

                        <p>Funny thing: the Jurassic scenes actually work better as sketches. The loose lines suggest motion and chaos better than clean renders did. When a T-Rex is chasing a minivan, you don't want everything looking too composed.</p>

                        <p>Some panels still need work. The portal jump sequence is confusing in a few spots. But the overall arc reads now.</p>

                        <h2>Character Concepts: Getting Started</h2>

                        <p>Started the formal character concept work. Not the 3D models yet. Just nailing down the designs on paper before committing to geometry.</p>

                        <p>Mia and Leo are mostly figured out. The human characters are easier because Pixar gave us a template to riff on.</p>

                        <p>Ruben and Jetplane are the challenge. A depressed fairy godfather and a dinosaur that farts colors. These don't have obvious reference points. I need to figure out how cartoony versus realistic they should be compared to the human cast.</p>

                        <p>Right now I'm leaning toward making the magical characters slightly more stylized. Bigger shapes, more exaggerated proportions. That way they feel like they're from a different world, which they are.</p>

                        <h2>The QA Thing Is Actually Working</h2>

                        <p>I wasn't sure about building automated QA for storyboards. Seemed like overkill. Art is subjective, right?</p>

                        <p>But having a bot that reviews every panel forces consistency. It doesn't have taste, but it notices when something doesn't match the rest. Panel 01-06 stood out because every other panel in that scene scored 3.8 or higher.</p>

                        <p>The system is simple: each panel gets scored on style, character recognition, action clarity, composition, and technical quality. Anything below a 3 gets flagged for review. Most panels pass. The ones that don't usually deserve a second look.</p>

                        <p>I'm keeping humans in the loop for creative decisions. But the bot catches the obvious problems so I don't have to review 200+ panels looking for the one that's broken.</p>

                        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>

                        <p>Finish the character concept passes. Get Ruben's design locked so I can start thinking about how to rig a guy with wings. Start blocking the first dialogue scene with the voice samples to see if the timing works.</p>

                        <p>Four days in. The movie is starting to feel like it exists.</p>
