- Expressions: `assets/characters/expressions/`
- 3D Models: `models/characters/`

### Supporting Characters (MISSING)

## Creatures

### Primary Creatures

| Creature | Concepts | Notes | Status |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| T-Rex | 3 concepts | stern, frustrated, territorial variants | HAVE CONCEPTS |
| Pterodactyls | 3 concepts | overprotective parents, clumsy duo, screamer | HAVE CONCEPTS |
| Herbivore herd | 3 concepts | Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, Parasaurolophus | HAVE CONCEPTS |
| Bioluminescent creatures | 3 concepts | Night raptors, plesiosaur, jellyfish-pterosaur | HAVE CONCEPTS |

**Assets Location:** `assets/creatures/concepts/`

### Story-Critical Creature Notes

1. **T-Rex** appears in Scenes 8-10 (Act 1) and Scene 33 (climax). Same T-Rex throughout. Current concepts are good variety but we need to lock in ONE design for consistency.

2. **Pterodactyls** appear in Scene 26 as the nest guardians. The "overprotective parents" concept fits the story perfectly.

3. **Second Dinosaur** (Carnotaurus) - mentioned in Scene 9 briefly blocking path. Could use T-Rex variant or skip this creature.

### Missing Creature 3D Models

None of the creature concepts have been converted to 3D models yet. This is expected at this stage - 3D models should be generated from approved concepts.

## Summary

The project has excellent coverage of main character 2D assets and environment concepts. The primary gaps are:

1. **Supporting characters** (Jenny, McNattin) have no assets
2. **Police station/car** environments are missing (critical for Act 2)
3. **Props** have no dedicated assets
4. **3D models** are missing for key characters (Ruben, Jetplane, creatures)

The storyboard-to-asset pipeline is approximately 65% complete for what the story requires. Act 1 is best covered, Act 2 has the most gaps, and Act 3 needs creature 3D models for the climax.
