## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Scene 2 & 3 render quality is exceptional** - Pixar-like quality, consistent lighting, atmospheric
2. **Emotional close-ups excel** - Panel 01-08 (Mia's face) shows strong character expression capability
3. **Action scenes read clearly** - Running in rain, driving in storm all convey motion effectively
4. **Composition is generally strong** - Good use of depth, framing, and visual hierarchy

### Issues Requiring Attention

#### Critical
- ~~**Panel 01-06 (TV static)**~~: **RESOLVED** - Panel regenerated to show TV with cartoon dinosaur being disrupted by interference. Now properly foreshadows time warp event.

#### Moderate
- **Style inconsistency**: Scene 1 uses rough sketches while Scenes 2-3 use polished renders. Consider:
  - Upgrading Scene 1 sketches to rendered style for consistency
  - Or accepting intentional contrast (sketch = inside/emotional, render = outside/action)

#### Minor
- **Panel 01-01**: Kids on couch hard to identify. Consider slightly closer framing or more detail
- **Panel 01-04**: Multiple figures make scene busy. Clearer staging would help

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ~~**Redraw or clarify Panel 01-06**~~ - **DONE** - Panel regenerated with improved composition
2. **Decide on style approach** - Commit to either unified rendered style or intentional sketch/render contrast

### For Remaining 41 Panels
- Maintain the high quality established in Scenes 2-3
- Prioritize emotional close-ups which test well
- Ensure all action scenes have clear staging
- Keep establishing shots atmospheric

### Production Notes
- Scene 1 character sketches could serve as reference for 3D modeling
- Scene 2-3 renders are near-production quality
- Mia's design (Panel 01-08) should be locked as character reference
