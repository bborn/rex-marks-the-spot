------------------------

The trailer is here.

"Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" — an animated movie about two kids who have to rescue their parents from the Jurassic era. With help from a depressed fairy godfather and a dinosaur that farts rainbows.

Yes, really.

I'm making this entire film by myself using AI tools and Blender. No studio. No animation team. Just one person and a bunch of AI-assisted tools figuring it out in public.

The process is messy. Some of it works on the first try. Some of it takes eight rounds of iteration and still looks wrong. I'm sharing all of it.

Here's what you'll find if you follow along:
- The real process behind AI-assisted filmmaking
- Character designs, storyboards, 3D models
- What works, what doesn't, and what's weird
- An honest take on making art with AI tools

The movie follows Mia (8) and Leo (5) after their parents disappear through a time warp on date night. They team up with Ruben — a fairy godfather who's given up on magic — and Jetplane — a dinosaur with a very unusual talent — to bring their family back together.

REEL VS POST RECOMMENDATION
----------------------------

POST THE TRAILER AS BOTH:

1. FEED POST (Main grid post):
   - Format: Reel (video) — Instagram prioritizes video in feed
   - Aspect ratio: 9:16 (vertical) or 1:1 (square) crop of trailer
   - Duration: Full trailer (~70 seconds) is fine for Reels
   - Cover image: Choose the most visually striking frame (Jetplane or T-Rex moment)
   - Pin to profile grid

2. REEL (separate post, optimized for discovery):
   - Cut a 15-30 second highlight reel from the trailer
   - Best moments: Time warp → T-Rex reveal → Jetplane farts → Family reunion
   - Add trending audio if appropriate (or keep original trailer audio)
   - More likely to hit Explore page than the full trailer
   - Caption: shorter version of main caption

3. STORIES (day of posting):
   - Use the story slides above
   - Post throughout the day (morning, afternoon, evening)
   - Include countdown sticker if doing a premiere
   - Share any early engagement/comments

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Post full trailer as Reel (main announcement)
2. Stories with slides above (same day)
3. 15-30 sec highlight Reel (next day, for discovery)
