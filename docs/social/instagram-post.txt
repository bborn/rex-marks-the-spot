INSTAGRAM - TRAILER ANNOUNCEMENT
=================================

CAPTION
-------

made a trailer for this movie i've been working on. it's rough but it's done.

it's called "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" - two kids have to rescue their parents from the jurassic era with help from a depressed fairy godfather and a dinosaur that farts rainbows.

yes really.

i'm making this whole thing by myself with AI tools and blender. is it good? not yet. does it look like a first attempt? absolutely. but that's the point - i'm learning this stuff in public.

some shots work. some need like three more tries. the transitions are janky. the timing's off in places. welcome to version 1.

AI doesn't magically make you an animator. it just lets you fail faster and iterate. which is good because i'm doing a lot of both.

made with claude, gemini, blender, meshy, and a lot of "well that didn't work"

if you're into watching someone figure out AI filmmaking in real time, complete with all the weird results and things that break - full trailer's on youtube (link in bio)

no hype. just documenting what actually happens when you try to make a movie with AI tools.

also there's a dinosaur that farts rainbows so there's that.
