## Tweet 1/5 (Thread opener)

**Text:**
```
Character lock is done. All six characters in "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" have approved turnaround sheets.

This means we stop changing how they look and start building them in 3D.

One week. Dozens of iterations. One character nearly broke me.

## Tweet 2/5 (The family)

**Text:**
```
The family came together pretty well. Mia (8) locked on her 4th design. Leo (5) took 9 iterations - turns out making a kid look five and not seven is harder than you'd think.

The gap in Leo's front teeth was the detail that finally made him feel right.

## Tweet 3/5 (Ruben - the hard one)

**Text:**
```
The hardest character was Ruben, the fairy godfather.

He's supposed to look like he peaked in the Renaissance and has been coasting since. Droopy wings. Eye bags. Janitor energy.

AI really wants to make fairy characters look magical. Getting it to make one who's given up took the most iterations of any character.

**Alt text:** Ruben character turnaround - tired-looking fairy godfather with drooping wings, wild gray hair, faded purple vest, holding a dented wand

## Tweet 4/5 (Jetplane)

**Text:**
```
Then there's Jetplane. A dinosaur who farts rainbows.

Opposite problem from Ruben - every version looked great. AI loves making cute creatures. Huge amber eyes, pink toe beans, orange neck ruff.

The real challenge was making him feel like he belongs in the same movie as the human characters.

## Tweet 5/5 (What's next)

**Text:**
```
Character lock feels like the real start of production. Everything before this was figuring out what the movie looks like. Now we know.

Next: turning these turnarounds into rigged 3D models.
