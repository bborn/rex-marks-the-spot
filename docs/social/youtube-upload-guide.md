## Description

```
Two kids. A depressed fairy godfather. A dinosaur that farts rainbows. And parents stuck in the Jurassic era.

When Mia and Leo's parents vanish through a time warp on date night, the kids team up with Ruben — a washed-up fairy godfather — and Jetplane — a very unusual dinosaur — to bring them home.

FAIRY DINOSAUR DATE NIGHT is a full-length animated film made with AI-assisted tools and Blender. We're documenting every step of the process.

ABOUT THIS FILM:
Fairy Dinosaur Date Night is an experiment in AI-assisted filmmaking. One person, AI tools, and Blender — making a movie that would normally take a studio. We share everything: the wins, the failures, and the weird middle ground.

AI tools used: Claude, Gemini, Blender + Python automation, Meshy, Tripo AI
