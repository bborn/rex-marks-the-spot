## Title

```
Fairy Dinosaur Date Night - First Trailer (Made With AI, It Shows)
```

---

## Description

```
i made a trailer for an animated movie i'm working on. it's not good yet but here we are.

the movie's about two kids who have to rescue their parents after they get zapped to dinosaur times during date night. they team up with a washed-up fairy godfather and a dinosaur that farts in colors.

real talk: this is my first time making an animated film. i'm using AI tools and blender and mostly just figuring it out as i go. the trailer's rough. transitions are janky. timing's off. some shots work, most need more work.

but that's the whole point - i'm documenting what it's actually like to learn these tools. not the highlight reel, the actual process.

what i'm using:
- gemini for storyboards (then manually fixing them)
- AI tools for 3D models (then cleaning them up in blender)
- blender for scenes and rendering
- claude for coordination
- suno for music (this version anyway)

this is version 1. there'll be more versions. probably many more versions.

if you want to see what AI filmmaking actually looks like when you're learning - no hype, just the messy reality - that's what this is.

also there's a dinosaur that farts rainbows which honestly might be the best part.
