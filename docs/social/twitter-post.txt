What is this? It's an animated movie I'm making with AI tools and Blender.

No studio. No team. Just me, Claude, Gemini, and a lot of iteration.

I'm documenting the entire process — the wins AND the spectacular failures.

TWEET 3:

The pitch: Mia (8) and Leo (5) have to rescue their parents after a time warp sends them to the Jurassic era on date night.

Their help? A fairy godfather who peaked in the Renaissance and a dinosaur with a very colorful digestive system.


TWEET 4:

The AI filmmaking part is real. Storyboards, 3D models, animation pipeline — all built with AI-assisted tools.

But AI doesn't replace the creative decisions. It makes them possible for one person.

I'll share what works and what doesn't. No hype.
