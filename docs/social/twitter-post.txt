TWEET 2 (Reply to main tweet):

look i'll be real with you - this is my first time trying to make an animated film and it shows

using AI tools + blender. some parts turned out ok. most parts didn't.

but that's literally the whole point - documenting what it's actually like to learn this stuff


TWEET 3:

the story: mia (8) and leo (5) have to rescue their parents from dinosaurs

they get help from a fairy godfather who's completely checked out and a dinosaur with a very specific talent

is the animation good? no. is there a rainbow-farting dinosaur? yes.


TWEET 4:

AI tools don't make you pixar overnight

they just let you make bad animation faster while you figure things out

storyboards, 3D models, the whole pipeline - all AI-assisted, all manually fixed afterward

sharing everything at https://rexmarksthespot.com


TWEET 5:

anyway if you want to watch someone stumble through AI filmmaking with zero idea what they're doing - that's this

no polish, no hype, just trying stuff and sharing what happens

the dinosaur farting rainbows is real though. that part i'm committed to.
