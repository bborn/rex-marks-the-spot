# Twitter Content Queue - @rex_the_movie

Ready-to-post tweets for the Rex Marks The Spot / Fairy Dinosaur Date Night production.

**Voice Notes**: First person ("I"), conversational, honest about the process, no hype or corporate speak. This is a passion project documented transparently.

## Tweet 1: Character Reveal - Jetplane

**Tweet:**
```
Meet Jetplane. He's a dinosaur who farts rainbows. I know how that sounds.

But here's the thing - he's also the emotional heart of this movie. When he's scared, you'll feel it. When he's brave for the kids despite being terrified, you'll get it.

Yes, really.
```

**Suggested Image:** `assets/characters/jetplane_preview.png` (3D model render of Jetplane)

**Type:** Character Reveal

## Tweet 2: Production Update - Storyboards Complete

**Tweet:**
```
Act 1 storyboards are done. 56 panels across 10 scenes. Time warp portals, a T-Rex reveal, a chase sequence, and a cave where two parents realize they've left their kids behind.

That last part was harder to draw than I expected.
```

**Type:** Production Update

## Tweet 3: Environment Art - Jurassic World

**Tweet:**
```
Building the Jurassic swamp. Giant ferns, humid atmosphere, pterodactyls in the distance.

This is where everything goes wrong for the parents. Beautiful place to be stranded though.
```

**Type:** Teaser Image

## Tweet 4: Behind-the-Scenes - AI Workflow

**Tweet:**
```
Making a movie with AI tools is weird. Half the time I'm amazed at what's possible. The other half I'm explaining to a language model why a dinosaur's tail shouldn't clip through the ground.

Today was a tail day.
```

**Suggested Image:** Screenshot of Blender workspace (capture during production)

**Type:** Behind-the-Scenes

## Tweet 5: Character Reveal - Ruben

**Tweet:**
```
This is Ruben. He's a fairy godfather who's given up on magic.

Droopy wings. Eye bags. The whole vibe of someone who peaked in the Renaissance and has been coasting since.

His character arc is basically "reluctant hero despite himself."
```

**Suggested Image:** `assets/models/characters/ruben.blend` (render a still from the Blender file)

**Type:** Character Reveal

---

## Tweet 6: Production Update - Environment Art

**Tweet:**
```
Environment art status: the family home, the Jurassic swamp, and the time warp tunnel are done.

Still need: the fairy godfather's realm, the dinosaur nesting area, and whatever the inside of a T-Rex's mouth looks like up close.

(That last one is unfortunately plot-relevant.)
```

**Type:** Production Update

## Tweet 7: Story Tease - The Premise

**Tweet:**
```
"Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" in one sentence:

Two kids rescue their parents from the Jurassic era with help from a depressed fairy godfather and a rainbow-farting dinosaur.

I've been working on this for months. Still not tired of typing that sentence.
```

**Suggested Image:** `assets/environments/time_warp_effect/time_warp_effect_tunnel.png`

**Type:** Teaser

## Tweet 8: Behind-the-Scenes - The Process

**Tweet:**
```
The screenplay is 28 pages. The storyboards will be ~200 panels. Each panel needs an image, timing, audio notes.

Then 3D models, animation, rendering, compositing, sound design, music.

This is either going to be amazing or a spectacular public failure. Either way: interesting.
```

**Suggested Image:** `storyboards/act1/panels/scene-08-jurassic-swamp.md` panel or a grid showing multiple storyboard panels

**Type:** Behind-the-Scenes

## Tweet 9: Character Moment - Jetplane Expressions

**Tweet:**
```
Spent the day on Jetplane's expressions. He has:
- Pure Joy (playing with kids)
- Terrified (T-Rex encounters)
- Brave Despite Fear (protecting friends)
- "The Fart Face" (pre-rainbow)

That last one has very specific animation requirements.
```

**Suggested Image:** Expression sheet or `assets/characters/jetplane_preview.png` with expression overlay

**Type:** Behind-the-Scenes / Character

## Tweet 10: Production Philosophy

**Tweet:**
```
I'm not replacing artists. I'm one person trying to make a movie that would normally require a studio.

AI is how I'm attempting it. Some of it works great. Some of it needs eight rounds of iteration.

I'll tell you which is which. No hype, just the actual process.
```

**Type:** Production Update / Philosophy

## Posting Schedule Recommendation

Mix of content types spread across the week:
- **Monday**: Production update (progress on the movie)
- **Wednesday**: Character reveal or teaser image
- **Friday**: Behind-the-scenes (process, failures, learnings)

**Optimal times**: 9am, 12pm, or 6pm (audience dependent)

---

## Image Preparation Notes

Before posting, images should be:
1. Cropped to 16:9 or 1:1 for Twitter display
2. Compressed if over 5MB
3. Alt text written for accessibility
4. Watermarked with @rex_the_movie if sharing final art

---

## Future Content Ideas

- Short video clips of animation tests
- Side-by-side: storyboard panel vs final render
- Character turnarounds as carousel posts
- "Making of" threads for specific scenes
- Polls: "Which character should we reveal next?"
