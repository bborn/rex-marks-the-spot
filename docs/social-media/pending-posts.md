## Post 1: Storyboard Style Update

### X/Twitter (280 chars)

We changed our storyboard style. Less "final frame" polish, more rough sketches like Pixar uses in early development.

Why? Storyboards are for story, not beauty contests.

Before/after comparison below.

**Caption:**

Big shift in our approach to storyboards.

We started with AI-generated "polished" renders—they looked nice, but they were solving the wrong problem. Storyboards aren't meant to look like final frames. They're meant to communicate story beats, camera angles, and emotional flow.

Real animation studios like Pixar use rough pencil sketches at this stage. The polish comes later.

So we're pivoting: rougher, sketchier panels that focus on composition and story rather than visual fidelity.

The result? Faster iteration, clearer communication, and actually useful storyboards.

## Post 2: Behind the Scenes - AI 3D Models

### X/Twitter (280 chars)

Honest take on AI 3D model generation for animation:

We tested Meshy.ai, Tripo3D, Rodin, and more.

Result? Great for props and environment pieces. Characters still need traditional modeling.

The tech is close, but not quite there yet.

AI-generated 3D models: the honest take.

We've been testing every tool out there—Meshy.ai, Tripo3D, Hyper3D Rodin, Hunyuan3D, and more—to see if we could speed up our character pipeline.

What works:
- Props and simple objects
- Environment pieces and set dressing
- Quick prototypes for blocking scenes
- Inspiration and reference exploration

What doesn't work (yet):
- Animation-ready character rigs
- Consistent design across multiple generations
- Clean topology for deformation
- Matching an existing art style precisely

Our verdict: AI 3D generation is a useful tool in the kit, but for hero characters, traditional modeling in Blender still wins.

Shown: Our Jetplane model—built the old-fashioned way in Blender.

## Post 4: Project Philosophy

### X/Twitter (280 chars)

Our philosophy: AI is a tool, not a replacement.

Every storyboard, model, and creative decision goes through human judgment. AI accelerates the work. Humans make the choices.

That's how we're making "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night."

### Instagram

**Caption:**

AI is a tool, not a replacement for creativity.

This is the philosophy driving "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night."

We use AI to:
- Generate storyboard drafts faster
- Explore visual possibilities
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Research and prototype quickly

But every decision flows through human judgment:
- Does this serve the story?
- Is this emotionally resonant?
- Does this match our vision?
- Would we be proud to show this?

The tech is exciting, but the story is what matters. Characters people care about. Moments that land. A film worth watching.

AI helps us make more. Human creativity decides what to make.
