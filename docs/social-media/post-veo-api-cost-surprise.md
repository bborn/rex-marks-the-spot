We let an AI agent loose on Google Veo to animate our storyboard panels.

It generated 18 clips. 100 seconds of video. The Scene 1 animatic turned out great.

Then we checked the bill: ~$50 in one afternoon.

Veo charges $0.35-0.40 per SECOND. Nobody set a budget alert. Lesson learned.

**Tweet 2 (reply thread):**

The wild part? The whole point of using AI is to save money on production.

Our agent iterated 7 times on a single panel testing prompts, then animated all 9 Scene 1 panels. Autonomously. Efficiently. Expensively.

Set budget alerts BEFORE giving AI agents API access. You're welcome.

Here's the animatic that cost us half our monthly budget:

How we accidentally spent $50 on AI video generation in a single afternoon.

We're making an animated movie using AI tools. This week we connected Google Veo (AI video generation) to our production pipeline so an AI agent could animate our storyboard panels automatically.

It worked. A little too well.

The agent generated 7 iterations of Panel 01 testing different prompts. Then it animated all 9 Scene 1 panels. 18 clips total. ~100 seconds of video. Completely autonomous.

What we forgot: Veo charges $0.35-0.40 per second of generated video. And nobody set up billing alerts.

End of the day we checked Google Cloud billing and realized we'd burned through nearly half our monthly budget in one afternoon.

The irony: we're using AI to make filmmaking affordable. And our AI just casually racked up a $50 tab while we weren't looking.

The good news? The Scene 1 animatic actually turned out great. The bad news? We could've gotten there in fewer iterations if we'd been watching the meter.

Lessons for anyone giving AI agents access to paid APIs:
1. Set hard budget limits before you start
2. Add cost tracking to your automation pipeline
3. An AI agent will optimize for quality, not your wallet
4. Always check billing before you go to bed
