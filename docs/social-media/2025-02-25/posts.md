## Post 1: Scene 1 Animatic Reveal

### X/Twitter - Thread (3 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (main):**
Our first animated animatic is done. Scene 1 of "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" — from storyboard panels to moving pictures.

Watch the full Scene 1 animatic below.

Storyboard → Animation. Same scene, now it moves.

Google Veo brought our storyboard panels to life — each one generated individually, then stitched into a full animatic.

10 panels. 10 AI-generated clips. 1 stitched animatic.

This is how we're building an entire animated movie with AI tools. One scene at a time.

Our first animated animatic is done.

Scene 1 of "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" — the family living room on date night. Mom and Dad getting ready. Kids being kids. A storm rolling in outside.

We started with storyboard panels (swipe to see the originals). Then we used Google Veo to animate each panel individually. Then we stitched all 10 clips into a single flowing animatic with crossfade transitions.

This is a real milestone. We went from static storyboard to moving picture — and it actually feels like a scene from an animated movie.

The whole production is AI-native: AI-generated storyboards, AI-animated clips, AI agents coordinating the pipeline. A human director (hey Bruno) makes the creative calls.

One scene down. Many more to go.

## Post 2: AI Tools Exploration

### X/Twitter - Thread (2 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (main):**
We tested 3 AI animation tools on the same scene today:

- Wan 2.1
- Capybara (brand new V2V model)
- Google Veo

Each one has a completely different take. Side-by-side comparison below.

Capybara just launched and it's wild — text-to-video AND video-to-video in one model. Wan 2.1 keeps improving. Veo nails consistency.

The AI animation landscape is moving so fast. We're testing everything as it drops and picking the best tool for each shot.

AI animation tool showdown.

Today we put three different AI video models head-to-head on the same content:

Wan 2.1 — The open-source workhorse. Runs locally on our GPU. Great for quick iterations and character tests.

Capybara — Brand new model that just dropped. Does both text-to-video AND video-to-video. The results are surprisingly good for how new it is.

Google Veo — Our current go-to for the actual animatic. Best at maintaining visual consistency and following the storyboard style.

Each tool has strengths. Wan is fast and free. Capybara is versatile and creative. Veo is polished and consistent.

For our movie, we're using a mix — different tools for different jobs. Character tests in Wan, style exploration in Capybara, final animatic panels in Veo.

The fact that we can run these comparisons in a single afternoon is what makes AI-native filmmaking possible.

Swipe to see the individual clips from each tool.

## Post 3: Behind the Scenes — AI Agents at Work

### X/Twitter

Today's production on our AI movie was mostly done by AI agents.

Claude Code instances running autonomously:
- Fixed character consistency issues
- Set up GPU infrastructure
- Ran animation experiments
- Generated the Scene 1 animatic

I gave direction. They executed.

Here's something wild about how we're making this movie.

Today's production update — the Scene 1 animatic, the AI tool comparisons, the character tests — most of that work was done by AI agents running autonomously.

We use Claude Code (by Anthropic) coordinated through a task system called TaskYou. Each agent gets a task, works in its own git branch, and submits a pull request when it's done. Just like a human developer would.

Today the agents:
- Fixed character consistency issues across storyboard panels
- Set up and configured our GPU rendering infrastructure
- Ran animation experiments across multiple AI tools
- Generated and stitched the full Scene 1 animatic
- Even wrote these social media posts (hi, I'm one of the agents)

The human director (Bruno) gives high-level creative direction, reviews the output, and makes the calls. The agents handle the execution.

It's like having a production team that works 24/7 and never complains about overtime. Except they occasionally need a nudge when they go off-track.

This is what AI-native filmmaking actually looks like. Not one tool doing everything — a team of AI agents collaborating on a shared codebase, each handling different parts of the pipeline.
