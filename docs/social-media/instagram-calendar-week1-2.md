We're making an animated movie called "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night."

Two kids discover a portal to the Jurassic era. A depressed fairy godfather reluctantly helps. A dinosaur farts rainbows. It's a family story about the chaos of parenthood and the magic kids bring to everything.

Here's the twist: we're building it with AI tools + Blender, and we're sharing every step of the process. The real process — not just the polished moments.

Swipe to meet the cast.

**Caption**:
```
Meet Jetplane. Our color-farting dinosaur.

Yes, you read that right. Different foods = different fart colors. It's scientifically accurate.*

*It is not scientifically accurate.

Jetplane is one of six main characters in "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" — an animated film we're building with AI tools and sharing the entire process.

He's equal parts ridiculous and lovable, which is basically our whole creative philosophy.

More characters coming this week. Who wants to meet the fairy godfather next?

### Day 4 (Thursday) — STORYBOARD SHOWCASE

**Type**: Carousel (5-6 slides)
**Pillar**: Story & Storyboards
**Format**: Scene walkthrough
**Post time**: 11 AM EST

**Visual assets needed**:
- Scene 1 storyboard panels from R2: `storyboards/act1/panels/scene-01-panel-01.png` through `scene-01-panel-05.png` (or similar available panels)
- Final slide: text overlay "650+ panels. 3 acts. 1 very chaotic family adventure."

**Caption**:
```
This is how animated movies start. Not with renders — with storyboards.

These rough sketches are from Scene 1 of "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night." A regular family evening that's about to get very un-regular.

We've drawn 650+ panels like these across all 3 acts of the film. Each one maps out camera angles, character blocking, and emotional beats before a single frame is rendered.

The style is intentionally rough — like Pixar's early development boards. Story first, polish later.

Save this if you want to see how animation actually gets made.

### Day 5 (Friday) — Stories only

**Type**: 4-5 Story slides
**Content**:
- "Week 1 wrap-up! Here's what we shared:" (recap of posts)
- Behind-the-scenes: screenshot of Blender workspace or generation script
- Question sticker: "What's your favorite animated movie?"
- Teaser: "Tomorrow — we're showing HOW we built all this with AI"
- Quick countdown or hype slide for weekend post

---

### Day 6 (Saturday) — BTS PROCESS POST

**Type**: Carousel (6 slides)
**Pillar**: Built in Public
**Format**: Before/after + process breakdown
**Post time**: 10 AM EST

**Visual assets needed**:
- Storyboard style comparison images — `docs/social-media/images/storyboard-style-comparison-1.png` and `storyboard-style-comparison-2.png` (in git, already prepared)
- A rough storyboard panel and the corresponding environment concept for the same scene
- Color script palette for a scene — e.g., `docs/production/color-script/palettes/act1_scene01_home_evening.png`
- Text slide explaining the pipeline: "Prompt > AI generation > Human curation > Blender integration > Final scene"

**Caption**:
```
We changed everything about our storyboards. Here's why.

We started with AI-generated "polished" renders. They looked impressive, but they were solving the wrong problem. Storyboards aren't supposed to look like final frames — they're supposed to communicate story.

So we pivoted to rough pencil sketches. Like Pixar uses in early development.

Swipe to see:
- Before vs. after style comparison
- How a rough sketch becomes an environment concept
- Our color script that maps the emotional arc through color
- The full pipeline from prompt to scene

The result? Faster iteration, clearer storytelling, and actually useful storyboards.

Would you rather see polished AI renders or honest rough work? Tell us below.

- End: "7 worlds. 1 adventure. Coming soon."

**Caption**:
```
Every location in "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" — from a cozy family living room to a bioluminescent cave hideout.

These environment concepts set the mood before we build the 3D scenes. Each one has multiple mood variations (warm, dramatic, whimsical) so we can dial in the exact feeling.

The Jurassic jungle and the fairy glade are personal favorites. Which one catches your eye?

### Day 10 (Wednesday) — MEET RUBEN (Character Spotlight)

**Type**: Carousel (7 slides)
**Pillar**: Character World
**Format**: Character design evolution
**Post time**: 11 AM EST

**Visual assets needed**:
- Ruben concept iterations from git: `assets/characters/ruben/concepts/` (v3-v6)
- Ruben final iterations: `assets/characters/ruben/final-iterations/`
- Ruben approved turnaround: `assets/characters/turnarounds/ruben_turnaround.png`
- Text slide with character description

**Carousel structure**:
1. "Meet Ruben. Fairy Godfather. (Yes, really.)"
2. Early concept v3 — "First attempt: too generic"
3. Concept v4 — "Getting closer, but missing the sadness"
4. Concept v5 — "Almost there..."
5. Final iteration — "That's him."
6. Approved turnaround — full character sheet
7. "It took 47 AI generations and a lot of human curation to find this guy. Follow for more character deep-dives."

**Caption**:
```
It took us 47 attempts to design our fairy godfather.

Meet Ruben — a washed-up fairy godfather who's been reassigned to babysitting duty. He's tired, cynical, and carrying more emotional baggage than his magic mop.

Swipe to see his design evolution. We used AI to generate dozens of variations, but finding the RIGHT version — the one that captures his particular brand of exhausted magic — took serious human curation.

This is what AI-assisted character design actually looks like. Not one perfect generation. Dozens of attempts, constant refinement, and a human eye making the final call.

What do you think of Ruben? Too sad? Not sad enough? Perfect amount of fairy godfather energy?

### Day 11 (Thursday) — COLOR SCRIPT POST

**Type**: Carousel (6 slides)
**Pillar**: Story & Storyboards
**Format**: Color script breakdown
**Post time**: 11 AM EST

**Visual assets needed** (from R2 `docs/production/color-script/`):
- `color-flow-overview.png`
- `act1-color-summary.png`
- `act2-color-summary.png`
- `act3-color-summary.png`
- `palettes/act1_scene01_home_evening.png`
- `palettes/act3_jetplane_farts.png` (for the fun factor)

**Caption**:
```
This is our entire movie told through color alone.

In animation, a color script maps the emotional journey of the film through palette. Warm oranges for cozy family moments. Cool blues and greens for the Jurassic world. Bright explosions of color when Jetplane does his thing.

Swipe through to see how the mood shifts across all 3 acts.

Act 1: Warm domesticity dissolving into adventure
Act 2: Lush, dangerous jungle tones
Act 3: Chaos of color — literally (thanks, Jetplane)

Fun fact: we generated these palettes from our storyboard panels using AI color analysis. The emotional arc was already there in the drawings — we just made it visible.

Save this for your next animation project.

### Day 13 (Saturday) — AI FILMMAKING HONEST TAKE

**Type**: Carousel (5 slides)
**Pillar**: Built in Public
**Format**: Educational / honest take
**Post time**: 10 AM EST

**Visual assets needed**:
- Jetplane preview image — `docs/images/characters/jetplane-preview.png`
- AI tool interface screenshot (Meshy, Tripo3D, or Blender) — new capture needed, or use description
- Side-by-side: AI-generated 3D model attempt vs. final Blender model
- Text slides with the "what works / what doesn't" lists
- Pipeline diagram slide

**Caption**:
```
AI-generated 3D models: the honest take from someone actually using them.

We've tested every major tool — Meshy, Tripo3D, Hyper3D Rodin, Hunyuan3D — to see if we could speed up our character pipeline.

What works well:
- Props and simple objects
- Environment set dressing
- Quick prototypes for scene blocking
- Rapid exploration of ideas

What doesn't work yet:
- Animation-ready character rigs
- Consistent design across generations
- Clean mesh topology
- Matching an existing art style precisely

Our verdict: AI 3D generation is a real tool in the kit, but for hero characters, human-guided modeling in Blender still wins.

This is what honest AI filmmaking looks like. Not hype. Not fear. Just figuring out what actually works.

Save this if you're exploring AI tools for your own projects.

## Production Notes

### Assets that need to be created/captured:
1. **Reels**: Need to create actual video Reels from existing static images (can use CapCut, InShot, or similar to add pans, zooms, music, and text overlays to existing concept art and turnarounds)
2. **Tool screenshots**: Capture Blender workspace, TaskYou dashboard, and AI tool interfaces for BTS content
3. **Text overlay slides**: Create branded text slides matching the movie's visual identity for carousel end-cards and stats
4. **Profile image**: Crop Jetplane character for IG profile photo (square, works at 110px)

### Scheduling recommendation:
Use a scheduling tool (Later, Buffer, or Meta Business Suite) to queue posts in advance. Schedule a full week at a time, then monitor engagement and adjust.

### First-hour engagement:
The first 60 minutes after posting determine algorithmic reach. During that window:
- Respond to every comment
- Share the post to Stories
- Engage with 10-15 posts in the #IndieAnimation and #AIFilmmaking hashtags
