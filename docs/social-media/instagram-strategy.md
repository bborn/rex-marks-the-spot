## Brand Positioning

**Who we are on Instagram**: The indie animation studio making a movie with AI tools — and showing everything.

**Brand voice**: Excited filmmaker energy. Technically curious, creatively ambitious, refreshingly honest. We celebrate wins AND share failures. We're not a polished studio pretending to be perfect — we're builders sharing the journey.

**Unique angle**: First fully AI-assisted animated film made in the open. Every storyboard, model, and decision documented publicly. The process IS the content.

**Target audiences**:
1. **Animation enthusiasts** — people who love Pixar BTS, art process, character design
2. **AI/tech creators** — interested in AI filmmaking tools, Blender automation, generative AI workflows
3. **Indie filmmakers** — aspiring animators, film students, solo creators
4. **Family entertainment fans** — parents and kids who'll eventually watch the movie

## Content Pillars

Rotate through these 5 pillars to keep content varied and engaging:

### 1. Character World (30% of posts)
Character reveals, turnarounds, backstory snippets, expression sheets, design evolution, "Meet the Cast" series. These build emotional investment.

**Asset source**: Approved character turnarounds, character preview images, backstory markdown files, creature concept art.

### 2. Story & Storyboards (20% of posts)
Storyboard panel showcases, scene breakdowns, before/after style comparisons, narrative teasers without spoilers. Show the visual storytelling craft.

**Asset source**: 650+ storyboard panels across all 3 acts, Act 3 animatic video, color script palettes.

### 3. Built in Public / BTS (25% of posts)
AI tool showcases, Blender workflow, pipeline breakdowns, honest takes on what works and what doesn't, milestone celebrations, failure compilations. This is our differentiator.

**Asset source**: Blog posts, tool screenshots, process documentation, version comparisons.

### 4. World Building (15% of posts)
Environment concepts, location mood boards, prop designs, color palettes, creature species spotlights. Transport followers into the movie's world.

## Posting Cadence

### Weekly Schedule

| Day | Post Type | Format | Pillar |
|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Monday** | BTS / Process | Reel (15-30s) | Built in Public |
| **Wednesday** | Character or World | Carousel (5-8 slides) | Character World or World Building |
| **Thursday** | Story / Storyboard | Single image or carousel | Story & Storyboards |
| **Saturday** | Highlight / Milestone | Reel or carousel | Rotating |

**Frequency**: 4 feed posts per week + daily Stories during active production weeks.

### Optimal Posting Times
- **Reels**: 7-9 PM EST (Wednesday or Thursday)
- **Carousels**: 9-11 AM EST (Tuesday or Wednesday)
- **Static posts**: 11 AM-1 PM EST
- **Stories**: 7-9 PM EST daily

### Stories Strategy
- Daily during active production (WIP screenshots, quick polls, progress bars)
- Behind-the-scenes that's too rough for feed
- Polls: "Which character design do you prefer?" / "What should we work on next?"
- Quick 15-second process clips
- Repost any fan engagement or mentions

### Highlights (Pinned Story categories)
- **Characters** — Character reveals and spotlights
- **Storyboards** — Panel showcases and scene breakdowns
- **Process** — How we make the movie
- **Tech** — AI tools and Blender workflow
- **Updates** — Major milestones and announcements

## Caption Style Guide

### Structure
Every caption follows this skeleton:
1. **Hook line** (first sentence visible before "...more") — punchy, curiosity-driving
2. **Context** (2-4 sentences) — what are we showing and why it matters
3. **Insight or honest take** (1-2 sentences) — the lesson, the surprise, the failure
4. **CTA** (1 sentence) — question, prompt to save/share, or link direction

### Voice Examples

**Good**: "This is what happens when you ask AI to generate a fairy godfather 47 times."
**Bad**: "We are excited to share our latest character design update."

**Good**: "Honest take: AI 3D models aren't ready for hero characters. Here's why we went back to Blender."
**Bad**: "Check out our amazing new workflow for creating characters!"

### Rules
- Lead with the most interesting thing
- Use line breaks for readability (not walls of text)
- Include behind-the-curtain honesty — don't just showcase, explain the struggle
- End with a question when possible (drives comments)
- Keep captions 100-200 words (long enough for substance, short enough to read)

---

## Hashtag Strategy

Instagram's algorithm now prioritizes keyword-rich captions over hashtag volume. Use 3-5 hashtags per post, placed at the end of the caption (not in a separate comment).

### Always include (1-2 per post):
- `#RexMarksTheSpot`
- `#FairyDinosaurDateNight`

### Rotate by content type (2-3 per post):

**Character posts**: `#CharacterDesign` `#AnimationArt` `#3DCharacter`
**Storyboard posts**: `#Storyboard` `#AnimationProcess` `#VisualStorytelling`
**BTS/Process posts**: `#AIFilmmaking` `#IndieAnimation` `#AnimationPipeline`
**Technical posts**: `#Blender3D` `#AIArt` `#GenerativeAI`
**World building**: `#ConceptArt` `#EnvironmentDesign` `#AnimationWorld`

### Keyword-rich caption approach
Instead of relying on hashtags for discovery, front-load captions with natural keywords:

> "Here's how we built our Jurassic swamp environment using AI-generated concept art and Blender — from rough prompt to final scene."

This gives the algorithm more to index than `#swamp #jurassic #environment` ever would.

## Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Post consistently 4x/week
- Build Highlights with categorized content
- Engage with #IndieAnimation and #AIFilmmaking communities daily
- Follow and engage with: indie animators, AI filmmakers, Blender creators, Curious Refuge community
- Share to relevant subreddits and communities for cross-pollination

### Phase 2: Community (Weeks 5-8)
- Start using Instagram Collab feature with other AI filmmakers
- Launch a recurring series (e.g., "Storyboard Saturday" or "Dino Design Drop")
- Run polls and Q&As in Stories
- Engage with comments within first hour of posting (critical for algorithm)

### Phase 3: Amplification (Weeks 9-12)
- Create Reels specifically designed for shares (transformation videos, surprising reveals)
- Pitch to Curious Refuge and AI filmmaking newsletters for features
- Cross-promote with YouTube devlog content
- Consider IG Live for milestone moments

### AI Transparency Approach
- Proactively label AI-generated content with pride: "Made with AI + human creativity"
- Show the human decision-making behind every AI element
- Frame as innovation and democratization, not shortcut
- This builds trust and avoids algorithmic labeling surprises

## Metrics to Track (Monthly)

| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 3) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Followers | 100 | 500 |
| Avg. reach per Reel | 500 | 2,000 |
| Avg. saves per post | 5 | 20 |
| Story views | 30% of followers | 30% of followers |

## What NOT to Do

- Don't post and ghost — engage in the first hour
- Don't use 30 hashtags (old strategy, now penalized)
- Don't post only polished content — the messy process is what differentiates us
- Don't ignore Reels — they're 3-5x reach of static posts
- Don't be corporate — we're indie, scrappy, and real
- Don't oversell the AI angle — show it as a tool, not a gimmick
- Don't post without a hook in the first line of the caption
