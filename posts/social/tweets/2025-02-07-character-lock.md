### Tweet 2 — Thread Reply: More Characters

> Jenny the babysitter - 15, permanently glued to her phone. Ruben the fairy godfather - anxious, washed-up, but still has a spark. And Jetplane - a dinosaur who farts in color. Yes, really.
>
> Every character was generated with Gemini and iterated until the designs felt right.

### Tweet 3 — Ruben's Design Journey (Standalone)

> The hardest character to nail? Ruben the fairy godfather.
>
> Early concepts kept making him too cool - leather jacket hipster dad with a smirk. But that's not who Ruben is. He's a washed-up, anxious C-class fairy on probation with droopy wings and a mop.
>
> It took 6 concept rounds to get there. The turning point was reading the full screenplay. Once we understood his arc - from "dead inside" to reluctant hero - the design clicked.

### Tweet 4 — AI Consistency Technique (Standalone)

> Figured out a workflow for character consistency across storyboard panels:
>
> 1. Generate character turnaround sheets
> 2. Get them approved as reference
> 3. Use image-to-image with turnarounds as input
> 4. Regenerate storyboard panels against the locked designs
>
> Just redid 5 Scene 1 panels and the characters actually look like themselves now. AI image gen is amazing at creation but terrible at consistency - unless you build the system for it.

**Character count:** 449 (long tweet / Twitter Blue)
**Images:** Side-by-side of old vs new storyboard panel showing improved consistency

### Tweet 5 — What's Next (Standalone)

> Character lock = done. Next up for Fairy Dinosaur Date Night:
>
> - Consistency pass across all Act 1 storyboards
> - 3D character modeling (AI-generated, then refined)
> - Scene blocking in Blender
>
> Making an animated movie with AI tools, one milestone at a time.

## Notes

- Tweets 1-2 form a thread; tweets 3-5 are standalone posts spread through the day
- All character images are approved turnarounds from R2
- Long tweets (3 & 4) require Twitter Blue for full display; they also work if truncated
- The Ruben before/after tweet is likely the most engaging - lead design journey content tends to perform well
