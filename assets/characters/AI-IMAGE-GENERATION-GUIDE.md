## Generation Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Consistency**: Generate multiple images and use consistent keywords
2. **Iteration**: Start broad, then refine with specific details
3. **Reference mixing**: "In the style of [Pixar film character]" can help
4. **Negative prompts**: Use to avoid unwanted elements
5. **Seed locking**: When you find good results, lock the seed for variations

### Midjourney Specific
```
--ar 1:1 for character portraits
--ar 16:9 for expression sheets
--ar 2:3 for full body
--s 250 for balanced stylization
--q 2 for higher quality
```

### DALL-E 3 Specific
- Use very detailed, specific prompts
- Mention "character design" explicitly
- Request "white background" for clean extraction
- Ask for "professional quality, animation studio level"

### Stable Diffusion Specific
- Use models trained on 3D animation (Pixar, Disney styles)
- Include "masterpiece, best quality" in positive prompts
- Negative prompts: "ugly, deformed, blurry, low quality, realistic"
- Consider ControlNet for pose consistency
