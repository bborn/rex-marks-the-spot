## Rigging Notes
- **Facial rig**: Emphasis on wonder, fear, joy - big emotions on small face

- **Body rig**: Toddler-like movement - running with arms slightly out for balance
- **Hand rig**: Smaller hands, often grabbing Mia's hand or clutching toy

## Scale Reference

- Compared to parents: About knee height
- Compared to Jetplane (small form): Jetplane is slightly smaller

## Animation Guidelines
- Moves with boundless energy but occasional clumsiness

- Runs with whole body commitment
- Hides behind Mia when scared (peeks out)
- Wonder and curiosity drive his movements
- Brave moments are big - full body commitment when he decides to be brave
