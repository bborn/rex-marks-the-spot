| Image | Style Score | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|

## Identifying Features to Lock

- **Hair:** Messy, tousled brown with cowlick (NEVER neat)
- **Freckles:** Clusters on cheeks and nose bridge
- **Eyes:** Very large, innocent brown eyes
- **Teeth:** Gap-toothed smile (visible in smiles)
- **Age:** 5 years old, smaller than Mia
- **Shirt:** Bright green with dinosaur graphic
- **Shorts:** Khaki cargo shorts

## Current Issues

1. Freckles inconsistently rendered
2. Hair color varies (sometimes blonde-ish)
3. Green dinosaur shirt sometimes missing/wrong color
4. Gap in teeth rarely visible

## Action Required

Generate canonical reference images:
- Hero portrait (face, showing gap-toothed smile)
- Full body turnaround
- Expression sheet

Use `scene-13-panel-02.png` style as target.
