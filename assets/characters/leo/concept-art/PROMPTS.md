- Gap in teeth (missing front tooth) important for charm
- Hair should look messy and never fully controlled
- Proportions: bigger head than adults (child proportions)
- Green dinosaur shirt is primary identifier
- Should look huggable and innocent
- Reference: Think young Pixar heroes (Nemo, Russell from Up)
