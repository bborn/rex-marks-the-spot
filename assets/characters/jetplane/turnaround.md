# Jetplane - Character Turnaround

## Overview
**Role**: Dinosaur Companion
**Species**: Fictional (described as "chicken-puppy-lizard hybrid")
**Personality**: Loyal, lovable, innocent, accidentally heroic
**Special Ability**: Farts rainbow colors based on candy consumed
**Merchandise Priority**: HIGH - must be iconic and toyetic

## Physical Description

### Size Variations
Jetplane has TWO size modes:
1. **Small Form**: About the size of a large house cat (18" long, 12" tall)
2. **Large Form**: Rideable size (~4 feet tall at shoulder, 6 feet long)

### Body Proportions (Small Form - Primary Design)
- **Length**: 18 inches nose to tail
- **Height**: 12 inches at head top
- **Build**: Rounded, soft, huggable
- **Head-to-body ratio**: 1:2 (big head = cute)
- **Silhouette**: Instantly recognizable from any angle; round body, stubby legs, expressive tail

### Core Design Elements

#### The "Chicken-Puppy-Lizard" Hybrid
- **Chicken influence**: Rounded body shape, slight waddle, feathery ruff around neck
- **Puppy influence**: Big expressive eyes, floppy ear-like frills, wagging tail, loyal behavior
- **Lizard influence**: Scales on back/tail, dinosaur heritage, toe beans

### Facial Features
- **Head shape**: Round with slight snout
- **Eyes**: HUGE, puppy-like, amber/golden with visible emotions
- **Pupils**: Large and round (not reptilian slits - too scary)
- **Nose**: Small, rounded snout with two nostril dots
- **Mouth**: Usually closed with slight smile; can open wide for expressions
- **Tongue**: Pink, slightly too long, occasionally lolls out (puppy)
- **Ear-frills**: Two soft, floppy appendages that move with emotion
- **Expression range**: Must convey joy, fear, determination, love

### Body Details
- **Torso**: Round, soft, squishy-looking
- **Neck ruff**: Soft feathery collar (chicken) in lighter color
- **Back**: Slight ridge of soft spines/scales running to tail
- **Belly**: Lighter colored, smooth, huggable
- **Tail**: Medium length, expressive, ends in tuft; slight rattle capability

### Limbs
- **Legs**: Short, stubby, but capable of running
- **Feet**: Three toes with soft pads (toe beans visible from below)
- **Arms/Forelegs**: Short, T-Rex style but cuter; can grab things
- **Hands**: Three digits with soft claws

### The Rainbow Fart Mechanism
- **Location**: Obviously the rear
- **Visual**: Colorful clouds/plumes emerge
- **Color varies**: Based on candy eaten (blue candy = blue fart, etc.)
- **Design note**: Must be comedic, not gross; think rainbows, not gas

## Key Views for 3D Modeling

### Front View
- Round, symmetrical
- Big eyes front-facing
- Ear-frills spread
- Small arms visible
- Stubby legs
- Belly visible

### Side View (Profile)
- Classic dinosaur silhouette but CUTE
- Tail extends back
- Back spines visible
- Ear-frills lay back
- Rounded belly

### Back View
- Tail prominent
- Back spines/scales
- Ear-frills visible
- "Exhaust port" for rainbow farts (kept subtle/cute)

### 3/4 View (Hero Pose)
- MERCHANDISE ANGLE
- Shows personality
- Eyes visible
- Body shape clear
- Tail curves expressively

### Top View
- Important for flying/jumping scenes
- Back pattern visible
- Ear-frill spread

### Bottom View (Belly)
- Toe beans!
- Soft belly
- Lighter coloring

## Large Form Differences
When Jetplane grows to rideable size:
- Proportions stay similar (same cuteness)
- More defined musculature visible
- Can carry Leo and Mia on back
- Tail becomes more powerful-looking
- Still fundamentally cute and friendly

## Rigging Notes
- **Facial rig**: Full range - joy, fear, determination, love, confusion, disgust
- **Ear-frill rig**: Emotional indicators - perk up, droop, swivel
- **Tail rig**: Highly expressive - wag, droop, puff up, rattle
- **Body rig**: Bouncy walk cycle, running, jumping, growing
- **Special**: Rainbow fart particle system trigger

## Scale Reference
- **Small Form**: Leo can hug, Mia can carry
- **Large Form**: Both kids can ride together
- **Compared to T-Rex**: Absolutely dwarfed (even large form)

## Animation Guidelines
- Bouncy, energetic movement (even when scared)
- Puppy-like loyalty behaviors (following, nuzzling)
- Chicken-like head movements (looking, tilting)
- Tail ALWAYS moving, reflecting mood
- Ear-frills react faster than face (emotional tells)
- Running: Bouncy waddle (small), powerful strides (large)
- Rainbow farts: Brief pause, slight crouch, then WHOOSH with expression

## Merchandise Considerations
- **Plush toys**: Round, huggable design
- **Action figures**: Clear joint points that look natural
- **McDonald's toys**: Simplifiable to 5-piece figure
- **Clothing prints**: Works in silhouette
- **Emojis/stickers**: Highly emoji-able face
- **Color variants**: Different candy = different fart color = collectibles

## Sound Design Notes (For Reference)
- Happy chirp/trill
- Worried whimper
- Excited bark-squawk
- Rainbow fart: Musical toot (think slide whistle + sparkle)
