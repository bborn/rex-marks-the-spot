## Notes for Animators
- Jetplane has NO poker face - all emotions immediate
- Ear-frills move FIRST, then face, then body
- Tail never stops (even in fear, it trembles)
- Eyes should have multiple catchlights for appeal
- The "plush toy test" - every frame should look huggable
- Rainbow farts are MAGICAL, not gross - sparkles, not stink
- Movement is bouncy even when sad
- Large form keeps same expressions, just bigger
- This character is designed to sell merch - keep it CUTE
- Should be able to convey emotion with just silhouette
