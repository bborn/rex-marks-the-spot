# Jetplane Reference Notes

## Status: NEEDS CANONICAL REFERENCE - HIGHEST PRIORITY

No approved canonical reference image exists yet. Jetplane is the merchandise star and must be iconic.

## Best Existing Examples

No Jetplane images found in storyboard panels reviewed (character may appear in later scenes).

## Identifying Features to Lock

- **Body:** Teal scales, cream-colored belly
- **Ruff/Tuft:** Warm orange fluffy neck ruff and tail tuft
- **Eyes:** HUGE amber/golden puppy eyes (largest feature)
- **Ears:** Coral-pink floppy ear-frills (emotion indicator)
- **Body shape:** Round, huggable, chicken-puppy-lizard hybrid
- **Feet:** Short stubby legs with PINK TOE BEANS
- **Tail:** Expressive, fluffy tuft at end

## Size Modes

| Mode | Size | Use |
|------|------|-----|
| Small | Cat-sized | Hugging, cute moments |
| Large | Rideable by 2 kids | Adventure, chase scenes |

Same design, different scale - proportions must be identical.

## Signature Feature: Rainbow Farts

- Colorful rainbow clouds
- Sparkly, magical effect
- Used for signaling in story
- Must be visually distinctive and family-friendly comedic

## Current Issues

No images to evaluate - need to generate from scratch.

## Action Required (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

Generate canonical reference images:
- Hero portrait (ICONIC, merchandise-ready)
- Full body turnaround (including toe beans view)
- Size comparison (small and large forms)
- Ear-frill emotion guide
- Rainbow fart sequence
- Expression sheet (8 emotions)
- Merchandise poses

Jetplane must be instantly recognizable, highly appealing, and plush-toy ready.
