## Notes for Generation
- Glasses are essential - never remove permanently
- Five o'clock shadow should be subtle but visible
- Gray at temples suggests stress, not old age
- Costume deterioration tells the story
- His arc is visible in posture: hunched→upright
- Watch is important prop (obsession with time)
- By end, eyes should look more present and clear
- Reference: Think Bob Parr (Incredibles), modern workaholic dad
