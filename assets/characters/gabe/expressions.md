## Notes for Animators
- Gabe's arc is visible in his face - starts tight, ends relaxed
- Glasses are character (never remove permanently)
- Five o'clock shadow grows slightly through Jurassic (subtle)
- Physical comedy potential: running in dress shoes, tie catching
- His "present" moments should feel earned and significant
- Watch is mentioned often - becomes less important by end
- When finally present with family, body fully faces them
