# Gabe Reference Notes

## Status: NEEDS CANONICAL REFERENCE

No approved canonical reference image exists yet.

## Best Existing Examples

| Image | Style Score | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `scene-21-panel-01.png` | 4/5 | On tree branch, stylized look |
| `scene-14-panel-01.png` | 3/5 | Cave scene, too painterly |

## Identifying Features to Lock

- **Hair:** Short dark brown with gray at temples
- **Glasses:** Rectangular frames, ALWAYS present
- **Facial hair:** Slight five o'clock shadow
- **Build:** Average, dad bod
- **Outfit (formal):** White dress shirt (sleeves rolled), loosened blue tie, charcoal pants
- **Costume progression:** Pristine → disheveled → survival mode

## Current Issues

1. Proportions vary significantly between panels
2. Style varies from Pixar to realistic
3. Costume not consistent with story beat (sometimes too pristine in adventure scenes)
4. Glasses style changes between images

## Action Required

Generate canonical reference images:
- Hero portrait (with glasses as signature element)
- Full body turnaround
- Costume progression sheet (3 stages)
- Expression sheet

Need to establish consistent proportions and glasses design.
