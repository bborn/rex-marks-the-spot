# Nina Reference Notes

## Status: NEEDS CANONICAL REFERENCE

No approved canonical reference image exists yet.

## Best Existing Examples

| Image | Style Score | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `scene-01-panel-03.png` | 4/5 | Good Pixar style, but dress is black not burgundy |
| `scene-21-panel-01.png` | 4/5 | Stylized, on tree branch |

## Identifying Features to Lock

- **Hair:** Shoulder-length dark brown, elegant waves
- **Eyes:** Hazel-green (distinctive from brown-eyed family)
- **Face:** Heart-shaped with defined cheekbones
- **Outfit (formal):** Burgundy cocktail dress (NOT black), gold jewelry
- **Signature:** Wedding ring (gold band)
- **Expression:** "The Look" (one eyebrow raised)

## Current Issues

1. **CRITICAL:** Dress shown as black in multiple panels (should be BURGUNDY)
2. Eye color hard to verify at distance
3. Style varies from Pixar to realistic
4. Hair sometimes too short or too long

## Action Required

Generate canonical reference images:
- Hero portrait (showing hazel-green eyes clearly)
- "The Look" close-up (signature expression)
- Full body turnaround (in BURGUNDY dress)
- Costume progression sheet
- Wedding ring detail

Establishing the correct burgundy dress color is top priority.
