- "The Look" should be iconic and immediately recognizable
- Wedding ring should be visible in most shots
- Burgundy dress is primary identifier (wine/deep red)
- She gets MORE beautiful as makeup fades (inner beauty)
- Strength grows as polish fades
- By end: natural, powerful, free
- Reference: Think modern animated heroines (Pixar/Dreamworks moms)
