### What it Communicates
- "I know what you did"
- "We're going to talk about this"
- "I'm disappointed but not surprised"
- All without words

### Animation Note
- Could become a running gag/meme
- Kids recognize it, react
- Gabe knows he's in trouble when he sees it

## Notes for Animators
- Nina's default is warm and approachable
- She internalizes before expressing (contrast with kids' immediate reactions)
- "The Look" should be instantly recognizable by second occurrence
- Her frustration builds visibly over early scenes
- Breaking point is earned, not sudden
- Her fear is functional - she processes and acts
- Love for family visible even when annoyed
- By end, her resting face is more open, less guarded
