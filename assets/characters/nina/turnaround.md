## Rigging Notes
- **Facial rig**: Patience, frustration, fear, determination, love - full range
- **Hair rig**: Starts controlled, progressively looser; good physics needed
- **Body rig**: Elegant movements that become action-capable
- **Dress rig**: Cloth simulation for formal look, simpler for torn version
- **Shoes**: May need to animate her kicking them off mid-chase

## Scale Reference
- Compared to Gabe: About 5 inches shorter
- Compared to Mia: Mia reaches her waist
- Compared to Leo: Leo reaches her knee

## Animation Guidelines
- Starts with controlled, elegant movement
- When patience breaks, movement becomes more direct
- Running in heels (comedic) transitions to barefoot (practical)
- Protective mother mode: fierce, no-nonsense
- By end: confident, speaks her mind, still graceful
- Her "look" to Gabe should be iconic - says everything without words
