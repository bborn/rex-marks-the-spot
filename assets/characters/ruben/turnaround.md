# Ruben Romanovsky - Character Turnaround

## Overview
**Role**: Fairy Godfather
**Age**: Appears 50s (actual age: centuries old)
**Personality**: Depressed, washed-up, rusty magic; finds redemption through helping kids
**Arc**: From cynical burnout to heroic figure; rediscovers purpose through responsibility

## Physical Description

### Body Proportions
- **Height**: 5'9" (average, slightly hunched from depression)
- **Build**: Lanky, slightly soft middle; the body of someone who's given up exercising
- **Head-to-body ratio**: 1:6.5 (slightly exaggerated, cartoony)
- **Silhouette**: Wings (usually droopy), unkempt hair, rumpled clothes create distinctive shape

### Facial Features
- **Face shape**: Long, drawn; handsome once upon a time
- **Eyes**: Tired blue-gray eyes with bags; can sparkle when magic works
- **Eyebrows**: Heavy, often furrowed or raised in world-weary expressions
- **Nose**: Prominent, slightly bulbous (comedic, hints at drinking)
- **Mouth**: Downturned resting expression; genuine smile rare and meaningful
- **Stubble**: Perpetual 3-day beard (fairy grooming standards have slipped)
- **Defining feature**: Dark circles under eyes; looks perpetually tired

### Hair
- **Style**: Was once styled, now wild and unkempt with strands going everywhere
- **Color**: Silvery gray with hints of former dark color
- **Texture**: Wispy, hasn't seen a brush in decades
- **Note**: Becomes slightly neater as he finds purpose

### Wings
- **Size**: Medium-large for a fairy (about 3 feet span)
- **Style**: Classic fairy wings, translucent with vein patterns
- **State**: Usually droopy, folded down; perk up when magic works
- **Color**: Iridescent but muted (blues, purples, silver)
- **Damage**: Slightly tattered edges (poor self-care)

### Costume Design

#### Main Outfit (Washed-Up Fairy)
- **Jacket**: Once-fine vest/jacket, now faded and slightly moth-eaten; purple/blue
- **Shirt**: Wrinkled button-down, half-untucked, stained with something
- **Pants**: Formerly elegant trousers, now baggy and worn
- **Footwear**: Pointed fairy shoes that curl up, worn and scuffed
- **Accessories**: Magic wand (dented, tape-wrapped handle); pocket watch (stopped working)
- **Overall**: Think "formal wear after sleeping in it for a month"

## Key Views for 3D Modeling

### Front View
- Slightly asymmetrical stance (weight on one leg, tired)
- Wings behind, drooping
- Rumpled clothes hang oddly
- Expression reads world-weary

### Side View (Profile)
- Wings' full droopy shape visible
- Hunched posture
- Nose prominence visible
- Belly visible through untucked shirt

### Back View
- Wings are the star - translucent, detailed, sad
- Jacket back wrinkled
- Hair chaos visible
- Pointed shoe heels worn down

### 3/4 View
- Best angle for character
- Shows wings and face
- Rumpled charm visible
- Marketing potential (before/after redemption)

## Rigging Notes
- **Facial rig**: Cynicism, surprise (when magic works), gradual warmth, heroism
- **Wing rig**: CRITICAL - wings reflect emotional state; droop, perk, flutter
- **Body rig**: Tired movements that become energized; magic casting poses
- **Wand rig**: Sputtering effects, misfires, eventual working magic

## Scale Reference
- Compared to kids: About Gabe's height but seems smaller (posture)
- Compared to adults: Average
- Wings add significant presence when extended
- Can potentially shrink/enlarge (magic)

## Animation Guidelines
- Movement is tired, resigned in early scenes
- Walks like his feet hurt (they do, old pointy shoes)
- Wings react to emotion even when he tries to hide it
- Magic casting: starts sputtering, builds to confident
- As story progresses, stands straighter, moves with purpose
- Heroic moment: wings fully extended, pose powerful
