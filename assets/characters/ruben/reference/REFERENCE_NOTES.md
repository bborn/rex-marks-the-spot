No approved canonical reference image exists yet.

No Ruben images found in current storyboard panels reviewed.

## Identifying Features to Lock

- **Eyes:** Tired blue-gray with bags underneath
- **Build:** Lanky with slight hunch
- **Wings:** Iridescent purple-blue, DROOP when sad (key emotional indicator)
- **Outfit:** Faded purple vest, wrinkled shirt, worn pointed fairy shoes
- **Prop:** Dented magic wand with tape on handle

## Wing States (Critical)

| State | Wing Position | When |
|-------|---------------|------|
| Depressed | Droopy, dull | Default/sad |
| Interested | Slightly perked | Engaged |
| Heroic | Fully extended, glowing | Triumphant moments |

## Current Issues

No images to evaluate - character may not appear in Act 1-2 panels yet.

## Action Required

Generate canonical reference images:
- Hero portrait (depressed default state)
- Full body turnaround
- Wing states sheet (3 states)
- Transformation arc (4 stages)
- Wand prop detail

Ruben is visually unique - establishing his look is high priority.
