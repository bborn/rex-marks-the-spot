## Notes for Generation
- Wings ALWAYS reflect true emotion (most important detail)
- Dark circles under eyes should be prominent
- Wild hair should look like it hasn't seen a brush in decades
- Pointed fairy shoes with curled toes are iconic
- Costume was once magnificent - show faded glory
- His redemption arc should be visible in posture
- By end: same worn clothes, but worn with PURPOSE
- Reference: Think broken mentor character (Haymitch, Jack Sparrow) meets fairy tale
