## Notes for Animators
- Ruben's default is tired, but tiredness is a CHOICE (defense mechanism)
- Wings ALWAYS reflect true emotion even when face lies
- He's physically capable, just unmotivated until now
- Transformation should be visible but gradual
- His smile should feel EARNED when it happens
- Depression is played for character, not mockery
- He's a "fallen hero" returning to glory
- Comedy comes from contrast (tired guy, magical things happening)
- By end, his default expression should shift slightly up
- Heroic pose: make it BIG - he's been waiting for this
