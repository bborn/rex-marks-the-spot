## Notes for Generation
- Blonde hair is key identifier - bright natural blonde
- Phone should be present in most poses
- Freckles across nose and cheeks - subtle but visible
- Blue eyes, fair skin
- Pink hoodie is primary costume identifier
- Posture is casual/teen-slouchy, not upright
- Reference: Think typical Pixar teen supporting character
