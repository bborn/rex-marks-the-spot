                        <p>Welcome to Rex Marks The Spot — a production blog documenting our journey creating an animated film called "Fairy Dinosaur Date Night." This isn't your typical behind-the-scenes content. We're building this film using AI-assisted tools, and we want to share everything we learn along the way.</p>

                        <h2>Why We're Doing This</h2>

                        <p>AI in creative work is a controversial topic. Some see it as a threat to artists. Others see it as a revolutionary tool. We think the truth is more nuanced, and the only way to understand it is to actually build something.</p>

                        <p>So that's what we're doing. We're making an animated short film — not a tech demo, but an actual story with characters you'll care about. And we're using AI to help us do it faster, differently, and maybe even better than we could alone.</p>

                        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

                        <p>This blog will document:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Production updates:</strong> Where we are in the process and what's next</li>
                            <li><strong>Technical deep-dives:</strong> How we're integrating AI with Blender and other tools</li>
                            <li><strong>Honest challenges:</strong> What doesn't work and why</li>
                            <li><strong>Creative decisions:</strong> How we're balancing automation with artistic intent</li>
                            <li><strong>Character and story reveals:</strong> As concepts get approved, we'll share them here</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>The Story</h2>

                        <p>"Fairy Dinosaur Date Night" follows two siblings, Mia and Leo, whose parents accidentally get transported to the Jurassic era during what was supposed to be a simple date night. Their only hope for rescue is a depressed fairy godfather named Ruben and his companion Jetplane — a dinosaur with a very unusual (and colorful) talent.</p>

                        <p>It's a story about family, magic, and learning that heroes come in unexpected forms.</p>

                        <h2>Our Approach to AI</h2>

                        <p>Let's be clear about something: we're not trying to replace artists. We're trying to understand how AI can assist the creative process without losing what makes art meaningful.</p>

                        <p>Here's our philosophy:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>AI as a tool, not a replacement:</strong> Every creative decision still goes through human judgment</li>
                            <li><strong>Transparency over hype:</strong> We'll show you what AI can actually do, not what marketing claims</li>
                            <li><strong>Honest about limitations:</strong> When something doesn't work, we'll tell you</li>
                            <li><strong>Open process:</strong> Our research and many of our tools will be shared publicly</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>What's Next</h2>

                        <p>We've already completed the screenplay and our initial scene breakdown. Now we're building the Blender automation pipeline that will help us generate and iterate on scenes faster than traditional methods allow.</p>

                        <p>In upcoming posts, we'll dive into:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>How we're connecting language models to Blender</li>
                            <li>Our validation loop for quality control</li>
                            <li>Character design concepts as they develop</li>
                            <li>The challenges of automating creative work</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Follow Along</h2>

                        <p>This is an experiment. We don't know exactly where it will lead, but we think the journey will be worth documenting. Whether you're a filmmaker curious about AI tools, a developer interested in creative applications, or just someone who wants to see how movies get made, we hope you'll find something valuable here.</p>

                        <p>Thanks for joining us. Let's see what we can build.</p>
