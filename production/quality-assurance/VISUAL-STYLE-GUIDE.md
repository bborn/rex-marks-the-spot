## Character Design Principles

### Proportions

| Character Type | Head-to-Body Ratio | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Children (Mia, Leo) | 1:4 to 1:5 | Larger heads = more appealing |
| Adults (Gabe, Nina) | 1:6 to 1:7 | Slightly stylized adults |
| Ruben | 1:5 | Lanky but head remains large |
| Jetplane | Varies | Body designed for huggability |

### Face Design

**Eyes:**
- Large, expressive (40-50% of face height for kids)
- Highly detailed iris with reflection dots
- Eyebrows are key expression drivers

**Nose:**
- Simple, small, slightly upturned
- Defined but not prominent

**Mouth:**
- Wide range of motion for expressions
- Visible teeth for big smiles/shock
- Soft lips, not too detailed

### Body Design

- Hands slightly oversized (more expressive)
- Feet proportional but simplified
- Clothing has soft wrinkles, not stiff
- Hair has volume and movement

---

## Color Philosophy

### Overall Palette

| Element | Color Range | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Warm tones | Reds, oranges, yellows | Safety, family, love |
| Cool tones | Blues, purples | Mystery, magic, danger |
| Nature greens | Forest, jungle | Adventure, Jurassic world |
| Magical accents | Iridescent, rainbow | Ruben's magic, Jetplane's farts |

### Scene Color Temperature

| Scene Type | Color Temperature |
|------------|-------------------|
| Home/safe | Warm (3200K-4000K look) |
| Adventure/danger | Cool (5500K-7000K look) |
| Magical moments | Warm with cool accents |
| Dawn/dusk | Golden hour warmth |
| Night/cave | Cool with warm highlights |

---

## Lighting Guidelines

### Three-Point Lighting (Default)

| Light | Role | Character |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Key | Main illumination | Warm, soft |
| Fill | Shadow reduction | 40% key intensity |
| Rim | Edge separation | Cool accent or warm halo |

### Scene-Specific Lighting

| Location | Lighting Notes |
|----------|----------------|
| Bornsztein home (night) | Warm practicals, TV glow, cozy |
| Car interior | Dashboard glow, passing headlights |
| Jurassic swamp | Dappled sunlight, humidity haze |
| Cave | Bioluminescent blues, fire warmth |
| Colorful canyon | Rainbow light bouncing off walls |

### Emotional Lighting

| Emotion | Lighting Approach |
|---------|-------------------|
| Happy/safe | High key, warm fill |
| Scared/tense | Lower key, more contrast |
| Magical | Bloom, lens flares, color accents |
| Sad | Desaturated, softer shadows |
| Exciting | Dynamic, motivated light sources |

---

## Composition Rules

### Framing

| Shot Type | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| Wide establishing | New locations, scope |
| Medium | Dialogue, interactions |
| Close-up | Emotional beats, reactions |
| Over-shoulder | Conversations, POV |
| Low angle | Dinosaurs, power, awe |
| High angle | Vulnerability, overview |

### Rule of Thirds

- Place eyes on upper third line
- Place important elements at intersection points
- Leave "look room" in direction character faces

### Depth Cues

- Foreground elements frame shots
- Atmospheric perspective for depth (haze in distance)
- Overlap characters/elements for spatial clarity

---

## Animation-Ready Considerations

### Design for Movement

- Hair/clothing designed with physics in mind
- Clear joint locations for rigging
- Expressions designed for in-between frames
- Silhouettes work from all angles

### Readability at Scale

- Designs must work at:
  - Full screen (100%)
  - Half screen (50%)
  - Quarter screen (25%)
- Expressions readable at thumbnail size

---

## Character-Specific Style Notes

### Nina

- Posture improves through story arc

### Jetplane

- Ear-frills are primary emotion indicator

## Quality Benchmarks

### This Image PASSES If:

1. You could screenshot it from a Pixar/DreamWorks film
2. Characters are instantly recognizable
3. Emotion is readable at half size
4. Lighting matches the scene's story beat
5. Nothing feels "off" or uncanny

### This Image FAILS If:

1. It looks like a photo or photorealistic render
2. Characters look like different people
3. Style doesn't match the rest of production
4. Lighting contradicts the story moment
5. You have to explain who the character is

## Style Drift Warning Signs

Watch for these indicators that style is drifting:

| Warning Sign | Correction |
|--------------|------------|
| Images getting more realistic | Re-emphasize "Pixar-style" in prompts |
| Characters look different each time | Use consistent reference images |
| Lighting getting harsh | Add "soft lighting, warm" to prompts |
| Colors getting desaturated | Include palette hex codes in prompts |
| Expressions getting subtle | Request "exaggerated, animated" |

---

## Prompt Style Anchors

Include these phrases to maintain style:

**Always use:**
```
Pixar-style 3D animated film, DreamWorks quality animation,
professional character design, family-friendly,
soft lighting, warm color palette
```

**Always avoid:**
```
--no realistic, photorealistic, photograph, 2D, anime,
horror, dark, gritty, creepy, uncanny
```

---

## Style Approval Workflow

```
[New Image Generated]
        ↓
[Compare to Reference Films]
        ↓
   ├── Looks like it belongs in Coco/Luca/HTTYD?
   │   ↓ YES
   │   [PASS]
   │
   └── Looks like a different movie/style?
       ↓ NO
       [FAIL - Regenerate with style corrections]
```

---

## Final Word

When in doubt, ask yourself:

**"Would this frame fit seamlessly into 'Coco' or 'How to Train Your Dragon'?"**

If yes, approve. If no, iterate.
