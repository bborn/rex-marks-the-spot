## Scene 16 Visual References

### Color Palette
- Cave: Dark grays, browns
- Tunnel light: Golden (promise of escape)
- Phone glow: Blue-white
- Shadows dominate

### Mood Board Keywords
- Urgent communication
- Parallel escape
- Hope vs. pragmatism
- Parental desperation
- Forward momentum

### Production Notes
- INTERCUT with Scene 17 - Nina's voice heard through phone in police car
- Nina's emotional intensity contrasts with Gabe's practical focus
- Both approaches are necessary - communication AND escape
- Phone connection is fragile - this tension carries through
- Tunnel represents hope of getting closer to portal
- Scene should feel urgent but not panicked
