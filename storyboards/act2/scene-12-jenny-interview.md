### Production Notes
- This scene plants seeds of wrongful suspicion toward Gabe
- McNattin's interest in the "hesitation" is key plot point
- Jenny is helpful but unknowingly implicating
- Simple coverage - focus on performances
- Morning light should feel invasive (investigation in family space)
- Notepad insert is crucial - audience should read "hesitated to promise"
