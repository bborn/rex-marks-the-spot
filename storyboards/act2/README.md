## Act 2 Narrative Summary

### Part A: The Investigation (Scenes 11-13)
The morning after the parents' disappearance. Police swarm the house. Detective McNattin interviews babysitter Jenny, who reveals the parents were fighting and Gabe hesitated to promise he'd return. The kids tell the social worker about the TV going "poof" and finding Mom's glowing phone. McNattin takes the phone as evidence.

### Part B: The Connection (Scenes 14-19)
In the Jurassic cave, Nina discovers the phone is somehow connected through the portal. She tries calling out to the kids. Meanwhile, the kids are in the back of McNattin's police car when they hear static and their mother's voice through the phone on the passenger seat. They scream but can't be heard through the barrier. A melancholy montage shows both families struggling through their parallel ordeals.

### Part C: The Fairy Godfather (Scenes 20-25)
At the police station, the kids meet Ruben, their "fairy godfather" disguised as a janitor. He explains the phone is keeping the portal open "like a doorstop." His magic is rusty from being on the "fairy naughty list." In the Jurassic, parents share an emotional moment in a tree, confessing fears and making promises. Back at the station, Ruben helps the kids escape in a chaotic sequence of magic misfires. They steal a police car (Mia driving with Leo on her lap!), follow the phone signal, and jump through the time warp just as they finally connect with their parents' voices.

## Using These Descriptions for AI Image Generation

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Choose your AI tool:** Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, etc.
2. **Extract key visual elements** from each panel description
3. **Build consistent prompts** using the character/style guide
4. **Generate panels in sequence** to maintain visual continuity
5. **Iterate** based on needs

### Base Style Prompt
```
Animated family adventure film, Pixar-style rendering,
[scene lighting], cinematic composition, professional
storyboard panel, [shot type]
