## Scene 17 Visual References

### Color Palette
- Police car interior: Dark grays
- Kids' clothing: Bright contrast to dark interior
- Phone glow: Fading blue-white
- Daylight outside: Normal, oblivious

### Mood Board Keywords
- Frustration
- Desperation
- Adult obliviousness
- Physical barriers
- Connection lost
- Defeat (temporary)

### Production Notes
- Barrier is the visual villain of this scene
- McNattin is not evil - just doesn't understand
- Kids' screaming should be raw and painful to watch
- Ironic adult comfort vs. kids' real knowledge
- Engine noise drowning phone = connection severed
- This frustration fuels later determination to get phone back
- Scene pairs with Scene 16 - INTERCUT structure
