- Daylight through windows: Warm
- Phone glow: Blue-white
- Kids' clothing: Casual colors

### Mood Board Keywords
- Isolation
- Hope
- Recognition
- Connection
- So close yet separated

### Production Notes
- Short scene but crucial for intercut structure
- Kids' isolation behind barrier mirrors parents' isolation in time
- Phone connection is barely audible - audience should strain to hear too
- Mia should recognize it first (older, more alert)
- Leo's confirmation adds emotional weight
- This scene sets up the frustration of Scene 17
- Barrier = physical representation of the obstacle
