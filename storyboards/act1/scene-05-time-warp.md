**Center:** Deep blue fading to black/void
**Behavior:** Pulsing, pulling, gravity-like effect
**Sound:** Deep bass + high electrical crackle

### Color Palette

### Mood Board Keywords
- Shocking

- Spectacular
- Inciting incident
- Point of no return

### Production Notes
- This is THE key VFX sequence of Act 1
- Time warp design must be consistent throughout film
- Should be simultaneously beautiful and terrifying
- Car impact needs both practical camera shake and VFX
- Silence after vortex closes is crucial (audience processing)
- SMASH CUT to Scene 6 for maximum impact
