## SCENE-BY-SCENE TIMING

**Pacing Notes:**

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES

### Pacing Philosophy
Act 3 should feel like a roller coaster that keeps accelerating until Scene 33, then provides a satisfying deceleration. The audience should be exhausted (in a good way) by the climax and grateful for the slower epilogue.

### Emotional Core
Despite all the action and comedy, the heart of Act 3 is:
1. **Kids proving they're capable** (Scenes 26-27, 33)
2. **Parents realizing what matters** (Scene 28)
3. **Family reunion** (Scenes 32, 34)
4. **Changed behavior in the new normal** (Scene 37)

### Comedy Balance
The comedy should provide relief without undercutting emotion:
- Jetplane's farts are funny AND serve the plot
- Ruben's magic failures are funny AND create real stakes
- The police standoff is funny AND resolves tension

### The Promise Throughline
Scene 37's payoff depends on the audience remembering Scene 1's promise. Visual and dialogue callbacks should feel inevitable, not forced.

---

## TECHNICAL NOTES

### Frame Rate
Standard 24fps, with potential slow-motion at:
- 33-046 (collision approach)
- 32-035 (Leo falling)

### Aspect Ratio
2.39:1 widescreen recommended for epic Jurassic landscapes

### Shot Duration Guidelines
- Action shots: 1-3 seconds
- Dialogue: 2-5 seconds
- Emotional beats: 3-5 seconds
- Epic reveals: 4-6 seconds
- Epilogue: 4-8 seconds (slower pace)
